 Note to the knowledge-eager person:
  MEKA IS FULL OF INCORRECT EMULATION BEHAVIOURS.
  MEKA IS NOT THE BEST REFERENCE OF HOW THINGS ARE OR WORKS.

 Before anything else...

This document is only a quick introduction to some aspect of MEKA development.
For any further discussion, please visit MEKA development forum:
	
        http://www.smspower.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=7
	
I'd be happy to discuss anything over there, answers questions, and see
how we can all work together in a happy world.

 Introduction
---------------------------------------

At some point, I realized that MEKA had all advantage to have its code
sources opened. Letting people tweak the software, improve it, port it, 
learn from it. Benefits for everyone. Here we are, finally.

MEKA is my pet project. 
I started writing this software during summer of 1998.
Doesn't it feel like an eternity now?

My code is messy. It is hell. Far away from many common coding practices.
To get you an idea, MEKA was my first real project in C. At that time,
I was not even familiar with that vague notion called "pointers". 
Don't freak out yet.

Some parts are better than other, many are bad, some are very bad. 
For my defense, and my silly pride, I would say that today my coding habits
and knowledge evolved. I know that MEKA do not use correct coding practice,
but I'm just stuck with this software, and rewriting everything from stratch 
isn't always a viable solution:

So well, this code is hell, but it's better than nothing.
May it serves, may we can work together and improve it.

 Technology
---------------------------------------

See MEKA.TXT documentation, chapter 11, for a summary of the various
technology and librairies used by MEKA.


---------------------------------------
 Communication
---------------------------------------

Please communicate on the dedicated MEKA forum on SMS Power.

 - Feel free to ask any kind of question. I'll try to help.
 - You can post snippets of code and ask for explanation.
 - Some things may seems weird and not properly commented. 
   Show me and I should be able to say if there's a known reason for doing
   it the way it is done, or if it is just a mistake or unproper coding on 
   my part.
 - Feel free to suggest anything.
 
If you have an idea of some piece of work in mind, again, please communicate:

 - I may be able to help, provides guidelines, or ideas if I already thought
   about the specific feature you're thinking about.
 - May be already in the work.
 - Most important and likely, I may be able to give direction about how to 
   implement certain things given the current constraints in MEKA code.

I haven't setup anything yet, but it is probable that in the future, if
MEKA gets development interest, I can setup a source tracking system for it.
In the meanwhile, if you have something to contribute, let's discuss and
we can always find a way to implement your changes into the tree.


---------------------------------------
 License
---------------------------------------

Apply to hq2x.c, hq2x16.asm, hq2x32.asm:

  HQ2X is originally distributed under GPL license, which legally would 
  not fit in MEKA (with its current license). An alternate license has 
  been requested to the author, Maxim Stephin, who answered:

    "Ah, just use it... I don't care much about legal stuff.
     As long as it's not used in a commercial product, of course."

  Overidding GPL terms.
  
Apply to all code not by Omar Cornut: (see MEKA.txt)

  Unlicensed. Gray area. Kernel Panic. Ahah!

Apply to everything else:
 
 #1 This source code comes free, without any warantee given.
 
 #2 Any modification of this software must have this license preserved,
    and source code made available under the same condition.

 #3 Reuse of program source code is authorized for any purpose.

 #4 Reuse of embedded data (database, graphics) in other projects is 
    not authorized, unless given specific permission from me.

I know this doesn't look like a clear licence, and it may scare lawsmen.
I'll try to work it out to provide a better license in the future.
Please contact me ( omar AT cornut DOT fr ) for any question.

 How to Compile
---------------------------------------

Note: Several of the libraries belows are patched or compiled with
specific settings on my computer. This is for the main purpose of
linking required libraries along with the executable, while stripping
unused features. You may not need that, just keep in mind that your
executables may be bigger than the ones provided on MEKA homepage.

I. Compile for Microsoft Windows:

 - Requires Microsoft Visual Studio 7.1 with C++ compiler.
   (it's absolutly possible to make it compiles with older version,
    but you'll have to recreate the project or convert it)
   Note: Some version of Allegro may require Visual Studio to be installed
   in a pathname accessible without spacing.
 - Install standard UN*X like tools (for compiling the libraries)
   - GNU make
   - Probably standard rm/mkdir/mv tools.
   - You may get away by using Cygwin provided tools. Tell me if you succeed.
 - Apparently, compiling Allegro requires a GCC compiler for some reason...
   - Mingw GCC, or Cygwin GCC, or DJGPP
 - Install Allegro library, latest WIP
   - http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/wip.html#unstable
   - Set STATICLINK=1 environment variable.
   - Set STATICRUNTIME=1 environment variable.
   - fix.bat msvc
   - make
   - make install
 - Install zlib
   - http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
   - Compile static to zlibs.lib.
   - Add ZLIBDIR environment variable to ZLIB root directory.
 - Install libpng
   - http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
   - Compile static
   - Add LIBPNGDIR environment variable to libpng root directory.
 - Install NASM
   - http://nasm.sourceforge.net
   - Add NASM environment variable, set to executable path.
 - Compile !
   - MEKA project is in MsVc\Meka.sln , for MS Visual 7.1.
     (MsVc\Meka.dsw is for 6.0, but outdated. Some tools can convert 7.1 -> 6.0)
   - May require adding some paths to your Visual Studio configuration,
     such as DirectX path, etc.
   - Provided Makefile is outdated but may work if worked to be up to date.   

II. Compile for MS-DOS compatible systems:

 - Install DJGPP compiler and related tools.
   - http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/
   - Add DJGPP bin/ directory to PATH.
 - Install Allegro, latest WIP
   - http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/wip.html#unstable
   - Apply patches (already in my source tree).
     This may not be necessary. I have some DOS specific patchs.
     Contact me if you're interested (some may have been applied to 
     Allegro already, I'm not sure). Will compile without the patch,
     but some behavior may change compared to official builds.
   - Set STATICLINK=1 environment variable.
   - fix.bat djgpp
   - make
   - make install
 - Install zlib
   -> see I. Windows
 - Install libpng
   -> see I. Windows
 - Install NASM
   -> see I. Windows
 - Compile !
   - Use provided Makefile.
   

III. Compile for UNIX

 - You are smart guys, you can figure it out!
 - Install Allegro library, latest WIP.
   - http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/wip.html#unstable
   - ./configure --enable-static
   - make
   - make install
 - Install NASM
   - Get a package, or http://nasm.sourceforge.net
 - Install SEAL
   - Get a package, or http://www.sonicspot.com/sealsdk/sealsdk.html
 - Compile !
   - Use provided Makefile.
   - May have to edit some source code (unsure, will need to be worked out)
     - In *.asm files, may need to uncomment the %DEFINE lines at the topm
     - In sound/sound.h, may need to change <seal.h> by <audio.h>.
     - In Makefile, may need to change -lseal by -laudio.
 - Contact me thru the forum for any help. :)

 Hope
---------------------------------------

Don't get too depressed over problems or ugly sources.
With the support and continued work of various people, MEKA should
be able to evolve into the 21st century, get better, get cleaned, and
have plenty of sexy features for all to enjoy.

Let's work and iterate toward the better.

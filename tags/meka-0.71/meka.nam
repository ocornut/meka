; MEKA - Software Database
; Last updated 2005/06/12
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Database made and kept updated by Omar Cornut (Bock).
; This file relates to an important part of the MEKA / SMS Power projects,
; that is to dump, archive, label and version ROM images properly. 
; It is being updated regularly based on various data sources and analysis.
; Please contact me if you have any change to request/suggest.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Note about data preprocessing that is done by MEKA before applying CRCs:
; - Duplicated data removed (2x/3x/4x+ overdumps)
; - Sega 8-bits:
;   - 512-bytes header removed
;   -  64-bytes footer removed
; - ColecoVision:
;   - 128-bytes header removed 
;   - 512-bytes footer removed
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Note about additionnal information in name field:
; - Version is added to the name field, if there's several versions for a
;   same software.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; State of the Database:
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; All data are now being converted to a new, better format. In addition,
; extended analysis and verification will be made on a case by case basis,
; before adding entries to the new format. 
; - Names are verified based on original media/cartridge, box and manuals.
;   I am now paying particular attention to exact casing.
; - Every cartridge is being redumped and verified.
; - Each ROM is properly associated to countries where it has been released. 
;   In some case, not all country version were dumped and some countries are
;   being associated to a ROM under the assumption that the version of this
;   country contains the same data as the other one.
;     eg: European game dumped, Brasilian version assumed to be the same.
;   Whenever possible, everything is being dumped, and country association
;   are confirmed or corrected as new cartridges are being dumped.
; Entries in the new format are therefore to be all considered as GOOD and
; associated to GOOD dumps.
; Of course, it could always happen that errors were left, but overally
; the new database content will be more much exhaustive and accurate than
; any existing database.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Approximately 20% of the database was converted.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The top part of this file consists in verified entries in the new format.
; The bottom part consists in entries in the old format. Once every entries
; will be verified and converted, the old format will be made obsolete.

 Note to the knowledge-savy person:
 - MEKA FEATURES INCORRECT EMULATION BEHAVIOURS.
 - MEKA IS NOT THE BEST REFERENCE OF HOW THINGS ARE OR WORKS.
 MEKA is an old piece of software, most of which was essentially written
 pre-2000. Although MEKA is still competitive in term of available features, 
 newer emulators are generally more accurate emulation-wise.
 The SMS Power! development Forums and Wiki are a betterd place to share
 up to date knowledge about hardware and emulation.

Applies to hq2x.c, hq2x16.asm, hq2x32.asm:

  HQ2X is originally distributed under GPL license, which legally would 
  not fit in MEKA (with its current license). An alternate license has 
  been requested to the author, Maxim Stephin, who answered:

    "Ah, just use it... I don't care much about legal stuff.
     As long as it's not used in a commercial product, of course."

 Before anything else...
---------------------------------------

This document is only a quick introduction to some aspect of MEKA development.
For any further discussion, please visit MEKA development forum:
    
        http://www.smspower.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=7
    
I'd be happy to discuss anything over there, answers questions, and see
how we can all work together in a happy world while holding hands and
playing games using yet another hand.


---------------------------------------
 Introduction
---------------------------------------

MEKA has been in development since summer 1998 (it was actually my first 
proper project using C as programming language), and most of its codebase
was written in 1998-2000, an era when MEKA was a closed source software.

That is to say that although MEKA is now free software and open-source,
it hasn't been developed under this premise, and the code is pretty much
the work of a disturbed adolescent mind learning its way around programming.

In the past decade most of my energy has been put toward other projects,
but MEKA still gets some occasional love and care. May the code be useful
and hope some people can contribute in keeping MEKA an up to date software
and making it better.


---------------------------------------
 Technology
---------------------------------------

See MEKA.TXT documentation, chapter 11, for a summary of the various
librairies and technologies used by MEKA.


---------------------------------------
 Source repository
---------------------------------------

MEKA code is hosted on a public Subversion (SVN) repository.

SVN repository  @ svn://svn.smspower.org/svn/meka
SVN trunk       @ svn://svn.smspower.org/svn/meka/trunk/meka

Anonymous login allows read-only access.

Please e-mail me patches and they will be applied if deemed useful.

SVN write accesses are granted on a per-user basis. 
I am totally open to giving access to people demonstrating their value
to the project.


---------------------------------------
 How to Compile
---------------------------------------

Note: Several of the libraries belows are patched or compiled with
specific settings on my computer. This is for the main purpose of
linking required libraries along with the executable, while stripping
unused features. You may not need that, just keep in mind that your
executables may be bigger than the ones provided on MEKA homepage.

I. Compile for Microsoft Windows:

 - Requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (9.0) C++ compiler.
 - MEKA solution is located in srcs\projects\msvc\Meka.sln

II. Compile for GNU/Linux and other UN*X based systems:

 - You are smart guys, you can figure it out!
 - Install Allegro library, latest WIP.
   - https://www.allegro.cc/
   - $ ./configure --enable-static
   - $ make
   - $ make install
   - $ For Ubuntu see notes on Allegro website 
 - Compile !
   - Use provided Makefile.
 - Contact us thru the forum for any help. :)


---------------------------------------
 How to create distribution packages
---------------------------------------

Note: require 'make', 'zip' and 'upx'

In trunk/ directory (the directory containing the executable):

# make -f srcs/Makefile dist_src
# make -f srcs/Makefile dist_bin_win32
# make -f srcs/Makefile dist_bin_unix

---------------------------------------
 Just getting started!
---------------------------------------

Have fun!

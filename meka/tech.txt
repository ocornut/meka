 DB-9 joypads (and more generally, inputs peripherals) were of common usage
 on Sega Master System, Megadrive (Genesis), several older consoles, Amiga
 and Atari computers, etc.
 Although the DB-9 connector is shared by many controllers, not all uses
 the same pinouts as the Sega Master System controller. Old joystick might
 also have only one button connected.

 2. SMS Joypads (DB-9) to Parallel port adapter (type 1)
    Comments by Mike Gordon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This adapter schematic is natively supported by the MS-DOS version of MEKA
 through the Allegro library. The adapter is also usable under Windows using
 the DirectPad Pro driver.
 If you do not plan to use the MS-DOS version, building the second type of
 adapter is recommended.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note
 ----
 This is a copy based on the schematic available on the now defunct
 DirectPad Pro site. A mirror is available at:
    http://www.arcadecontrols.com/Mirrors/www.ziplabel.com/dpadpro/
 I'm not sure who is the original author of this schematic, but it is very
 simple and the common nature of the adapter make it somewhat public domain
 knowledge.

* You need a 25-pin male D-plug (DB-25) for the parallel port connection (to
  fit the female parallel port socket), and a 9-pin male D-plug (DB-9) for
  the SMS joypad connection (to fit the female joypad plug). The pin numbers
  should be marked on the plug itself.

* The type of resistor used (metal film, carbon etc.) is not important. The
  resistors can be soldered directly to the DB-25 connector, i.e. connect one
  resistor between pin 3 and pin 12, another between pin 2 and pin 11. (And
  a wire link, between pins 18 and 19.)

  The resistor value (10K) is indicated by coloured bands on the body of the
  resistor, as follows, from left to right:

   Either: Brown Black Orange       (gap)  Brown or Gold
       or: Brown Black Black Red    (gap)  Brown or Gold

* Use shielded cable, and use the outer shield of the cable for the Ground
  connection. Try and keep the cable as short as possible.

 After some research and digging around this is the diagram I have found to
 work best for me. As you can see above, there is no need for any diodes or
 resistors. This is a straight-through connection. All one needs to do is
 connect the proper pins from the DB 9 to the DB 25 connector.

 I used an old IDE ribbon cable and some crimp on connectors. That's it.
 (I used crimp connectors because my soldering skills are somewhat lacking)

 Select the "Linux-DB9" in the driver configuration window.

 4. SMS Joypads (DB-9) to Parallel port adapter (GNU/Linux)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GNU/Linux kernels starting version 2.2 supports a wide range of joysticks,
 based on the "Linux Joystick Driver" project:
    http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/
 Please refer to appropriate documentation (joystick-parport.txt) for
 detailed instruction about how to build different kind of adapters.

 5. SMS 3-D Glasses to Serial/COM port adapter
    Unknown original author. Comments by Frank and Mike Gordon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This adapter schematic is natively supported by the MS-DOS and Windows
 versions of MEKA. As of yet, UN*X versions does not support this feature.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Please refer to SmsCartPad homepage for more detailed instruction:
    http://www.smspower.org/smscartpad/3d_glasses.shtml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note
 ----
 About the MS-DOS version of MEKA: the SMS 3-D Glasses adapter should work
 even under in a Windows 95/98 command prompt, but I have not done extensive
 testing to confirm. Please e-mail me any problem you may have.

 The Nintendo Famicom 3-D Glasses are said to be compatible with the
 SMS 3-D Glasses, meaning that they should work with this adapter as well.
 I could not confirm it myself.

[FRANK]

This is my best attempt at a rendition of the circuit which connects my
SEGA glasses to my AT. I didn't design the circuit -- I'm a software
rather than hardware person. In fact I barely understand it -- as far as
I can tell, the .01uF capacitor & the 22K resistors act as a delay. The
outputs of the XOR gates feed back into their own inputs, thus producing
an oscillator. The "jack" mentioned in the diagram is the mini-jack
which is connected as standard to the glasses. "Centre", "middle", and
"outside" relate to the external connections, looking at the thing
end-on.

Caveat emptor... to paraphrase the standard software licence agreement:
It's as good as I can get it. If it doesn't work or blows up your
computer or your glasses and blinds you for life, I'll give you back all
the money you paid me.

[MIKE GORDON]

As far as I can see, the oscillator circuit is used to provide an AC supply
to power the glasses. The switching signal (+ or - 10 volts) applied to the
base of the transistor produces a high or low output on the collector, which
presumably is used to switch between left and right frames.

When building the adapter:

* Use a CMOS series 4030B (or 4070B, which is functionally equivalent). Do
  not use a 74HC series chip.

  Chip pin numbering:

      7  6  5  4  3  2  1
     +-------------------+
     |                   |
     |   4070B           < - notch
     |                   |
     +-------------------+
      8  9 10 11 12 13 14


* Use 1N4148 (or equivalent) signal diodes. The positive end is marked by a
  black band around the component.

      Negative  -  --|>|--  +  Positive


* The resistors should ideally be metal film types (blue-coloured body).
  The value is indicated by coloured bands, as follows, from left to right:

     22K - Red Red Orange           (gap)  Brown or Gold
      OR - Red Red Black Red        (gap)  Brown or Gold

     10K - Brown Black Orange       (gap)  Brown or Gold
      OR - Brown Black Black Red    (gap)  Brown or Gold


* The .01 uF (10 nF) capacitor should be a ceramic disc type, while the 22uF
  capacitor should be an electrolytic type.


* For the 2N2222A transistor (looking at it from below, with the pins towards
  you) :


                     o - Base


     Emitter -   o       o   - Collector


  Metal tab - /_/


* The serial port is a 9-pin D-type male connector, so you need a 9-pin
  female D plug for the adapter. Looking into the serial port itself, this
  is the pin configuration:

                 1 2 3 4 5
               -------------
               \ o o o o o /
                \ o o o o /
                 ---------
                  6 7 8 9


* Finally, the 3-D glasses jack is a 3.5mm stereo phone socket, i.e. the
  Walkman type.

Good luck building the adapter, and enjoy!


If you are going to work on it, maybe you can take the opportunity to also add full support for graphics modes 1 & 2 in the Tiles Viewer and Tilemap Viewer?
Right now the Tiles Viewer only shows up to 512 tiles but graphics 2 supports up to 768. Also Tiles Viewer doesn't seem to use the color table (even though the game screen view seems to use it properly) 
Memory Leak

Border Color emulation

Debugger: STEP OVER broken on line with breakpoint
MemoryViewew: input register/expr in ADDR field

<48 KB rom should heuristically detect possible use of sega mapper by counting of LD (FFFx),A and discarding those who have also have load in E000.FFF0 range.

Trackback: optimistically assume that disassembled lines (after >PC) can be included in trackback
Trackback: replace by ROM sized bitfield?

Easy save slot select in menu?

- it crashes when I lock the workstation (WinXP)
- single key shortcuts (with F6 and F7 keys for example) for run over (continue to next) and run into (enter) calls so that I can debug with two fingers on the keyboard and two eyes on the screen :) 

I just noticed this thread and after fixing this, it appeared that the Korean version of "Circus Charlie" also needs 2KB of RAM at $c000-$ffff

Hey there,

I was so happy to see my favourite SMS emulator was having another update! I downloaded the most recent beta in this thread, and discovered that it doesn't like being installed over 0.73, throwing up sound buffer errors. Doing a clean install removes this.

I've not had time to do much further testing, however one small UI issue that's always been there, and I'd like to see fixed if possible please, is the inability to set controllers outside of the order that Windows sees them in.

To explain: You can't change 3/6 Joypad 1 to Player 2, nor can you click it's controls and input any other controller except the one listed first by Windows. In my case, I have currently an MS Sidewinder Pro Flightstick and a Logic3 Arcade Stick both in USB ports, and Joypad 1 will only take input from the Sidewinder. 4/6 Joypad 2 takes the Arcade stick input, but not the Flightstick in turn.

Suggested Solution: Drop down box to map specific controller to Player X, or allowing Player 1 to be swapped with Player 2 with a click on that line in the box, thus swapping what controller it maps too.

My build is the 2012/12/31. 

markvt: The 'delete' key does not work in the cheat finder for me, only the 'backspace' key does allow to remove a value in the search box. 

Is there any emulator/setting that handles the Sports Pad input in a way that makes the games playable? Meka allows to use the mouse for it, but it always stops where the mouse pointer would reach the border of the screen. I've tried some other emulators, but none of them seemed to support it at all...

[B] Debugger: Variables window with live filter.
[B] Debugger: Preview memory regions on hovering register/instruction. 

Add a super-fast mode (faster than 1/9 for CLOCK-ing things like zexall)

Debugger seems generally weird at 1/9 frameskip, stepping instructions when not expected?) 
> As for the 1/9 bug: I think it is to do with the keyboard repeat code. Entering "j 0" gets me to 0 + however many instructions the debugger thinks I have held down Enter for. In frameskip mode I guess it is interpreting repeats after a very short pause. It ought to be realtime-based instead of emulated-frame-based?

//- tilemap viewer: mode 2: print more infos. add more addr settings.
- new feature: sprite viewer?
- new feature: audio channel disable? (psg & fm)
- reorganize inputs configuration panel?
- pro action replay 
- end-user timing (message time, double click) shouldn't be measured in emulated frames
- incorrect rom on command-line leaves a zombie thread? (sometimes?)
//- gui: show shortcuts
- GUI HOVERING SCROLL BAR BROKEN

In Hang-On (Safari Hunt) -> glitch even in PAL mode
I've noticed that part of the track shows in the background where it shouldn't (shown in screen shot with a highlighted red square box), also in regards to the track itself when it turns left or right, the track kind of looks like it judders.

Other than that not noticed any other problems and nice work on the sound :), works fine with my Creative X-Fi Xtreme Gamer, also forgot to mention I'm using the latest 0.80 build.
- bug reports:
  - "When pausing with the F12 button, the screen becomes out of align by showing a bottom border and a right border. " 
  - "Sometimes the mouse freezes for a couple of seconds. (I got this 3 times in about a 20 minute play). "
  - "I plugged in a USB-PSX converter before starting again and it did not crash then but any input instantly went Stick 0 Axis 0 -"

I would like Meka v0.74 to contain a Extra Debug mode called ''Sprite/OAM Viewer'' as seen by some modern emulators such as
BGB/No$GMB/NO$C64/Etc.

Not only that, SG1000/SC3000/Ect. and compatible Sprite and Name Table viewer. Can be used as a reference to
gain more programmers for older SEGA systems

But the only SEGA console emulators with Sprite viewer capability is a few 16bit Genesis/Mega Drive, Which I could not
find a modern one yet besides NES/GB(Color) stuff.

So I think it will be more helpful to debuggers for doing Sprites, if there is one for MEKA, It will become superior to 
the other Z80+VDP emulators. Beating MSX(2/+) Somehow

- Speed above 1/9 (for zexall)
Debugger: Count point. or full memmap count points.

(Actually, some way to enter a super-turbo-fast-forward mode (more than 1/9 frameskip) might be nice, especially if it can still hit a breakpoint directly. Debugger seems generally weird at 1/9 frameskip, stepping instructions when not expected?)

Fix default .sc mapper (eigo sakubun)
Namely if ROM is bigger than 32 KB don't stupidely ignore the rest of the data!!

Debugger: Many interesting mails from Maxim!
Debugger: Add support for F register in SET command (or individual flag, ZF, CF, etc.)

THE YET UNSORTED MESS (this is my notepad basically)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Define a string in the config file, eg:
 debug_breakpoint_label_prefix = "break_"
Then, when loading .sym files, automatically add breakpoints on
matching labels. This saves me typing "b <label>", and is designed for
"temporary" breakpoints on lines that normally would not otherwise
have a label.

Now I have a question. In some Master System games (made at 1993 to be exact) such as 
Sonic Chaos, Deep Duck Trouble have problems. Sometimes they are fine, other times the 
games crash after they get to the title card(Level Name) as these problems have been 
in previous releases. 

Proppy session debugger notes:
- 'breakpoint' window list
  - show list
  - with enable checkbox
  - edit/add fields
- breakpoint write: only when values changing, !=
- datadump sprite output is weird
Debugger: bind RELOAD rom on a key, or add 'reload' command

<cgfm2> can I increase the SMS display window size in GUI mode?

Jacko: Also I was playing Shanghai before with the FM Chip enabled and the music slowed down gradually 
(like a record slowly stopping) and then it slowly speed up again, MEKA has only done it once 
so it is hard to tell if it was my PC doing something or it was MEKA.

PRIORITY / FOR UPCOMING NEXT VERSIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alright, those things right here may not be always super important, it's
just that I noted them at the top of the file, thinking it would be worth
doing them now and some are quick work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Check galaxy force (supposed bug, couldn't reproduce)
  http://www.smspower.org/forum/messages/19568.html

- Add auto SK-1100 enable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------
 WINDOWS PORT PRIORITY/NOTES
-----------------------------
 - THE AUTO FRAME SKIPPER SUCKS
 - SOUND SUCKS
 - Windowed mode should fit the actual game screen size instead of having
   a screen-resolution based size (320x240)
   - This is a problem with how the blitter system works now.

-----------------------------
 CODE
-----------------------------
 - Write a MEKA coding style documentation.

-----------------------------
 WEBSITE
-----------------------------
 - MEKA 0.59 is missing from all archives?

-----------------------------
 VGM
-----------------------------
 - Built-in VGM player (implement Maxim VGM stub)
 - GD3: 
   - Japanese GD3 (for systems at least)
   - Option to create VGM without GD3.
   - Store user name somewhere, now that MEKA.KEY file is obsolete.
 - Check http://isweb38.infoseek.co.jp/art/rophon/data/download.htm
 - Tool:
   - Automatic trimming.
   - PSG access addresses logger/hacker (see notes under DEBUGGER).
 - Add feature to only start logging "when sound start" (for WAV log)

-----------------------------
 ROM INFORMATION
-----------------------------
 - Add an applet showing ROM+DB information (checksum, country, version, etc.)

-----------------------------
 NAMES / DATABASE
-----------------------------
 - Add Pirate flag ?
 - Better syntax error verbosing (currently there's none).
 - Generally:
   - Check Maxim's old & new e-mails.
   - Check Kevin Chase e-mails.
   - Fixes missing "the". 

-----------------------------
 PERIPHERALS/INPUTS EMULATION
-----------------------------
 - Emulate port 3F properly.
   Currently, its implementation is a joke.
   This however introduce some "interface"/"user-side" problems:
   - In-game changing of country may be fatal to non-joypad games.
     Warn for them? What else could be done?
 - Test Handle Controller / Bike Controller for SG-1000/SC-3000.
   How does they actually works? Why do they mention only a few games
   on the box, are they actually any different or it is just because
   one is left/right and other is up/down only?
 - SDI might supports Sports Pad, figure out hardware detection if so
 - Proper/better Light Phaser emulation.
   - Again, implementation is a joke. / but, it works.
   - Check Charles' SmsGun test.

-----------------------------
 PERIPHERALS/INPUTS HOST
-----------------------------
 - Support analog axis, damnit!
 - Add Message when changing Player 2 input (?)
 - Configuration of ALL inputs keys (functions keys, etc...)
 - Support mouse wheel for emulation.
 - Paddle Controller emulation:
   - Allows to setup sensitivity
   - It is possible to do something better ?
 - Support for MD direct pro driver (see unfunk's e-mail)
 - Inputs Recording
 - Interface mouse driver (who cares anymore).
 - Keyboard not qwerty
 - Player 2 default inputs on right side of the keyboard ?
 - Add both buttons & combo inputs
 - Be able to configure Rapid Fire speed.
 - Cursor is repositionned when enabling light phaser within GUI
 - Support for more than one mouse (for light phaser game)

-----------------------------
 SEGA KEYBOARD (SK-1100)
-----------------------------
 - Automatically enable (based on DB directive).
   - Keep a flag to know if was automatically or user activated.
     If automatically, then on ROM change it then can be disabled.
 - Clickable picture on the GUI (with sticky keys).
 - When SK-1100 is enabled, Monaco GP difficulty selection runs slower. 
   It is normal behavior?
 - Show sticky keys with PC keyboard leds.
 - SK-1100 is difficult to type with, and Mekaw's keyboard is strange:
     "]" is "["  "[" is "@"  "\" is "]"
     "yen",":","^"and"@" don't type.
   Maybe more. Please check it.
   I think this is solved.

-----------------------------
 BLITTERS
-----------------------------
 - Fallback to safe mode
 - Completely revamp the blitter systems.
   - Be able to handle blitter per system (SMS, GG..) and mode.
   - Add x3, x4 blitters, separate X and Y (be able to do a 2x3 blit, etc..).
     All combinations should be working.
   - Add stretching blitters (especially for windows version)
   - Lots of info in mind or on paper. Need to sort out, and maybe write
     a short specification document.
 - Selection of GUI video mode in interaction configuration window.
 - Avoid to quit when video mode is invalid
   - Handle video mode priority list, etc..
 - For Game Gear:
    H*2/Y*3 in 320*480, H*4/Y*3 in 640x480..
 - Filters:
   - Implement 2xSai filter.
   - Implement Scale2x filter (scale2x.sourceforge.net)
   - HQ filters
     - 32 bits version
     - HQ2X, HQ4X
 - Resize window
   - Easy to do for GUI.
   - Support for fullscreen blitter (hmm..?)
 - [Win32] Support OS resolution change.

 - VDP Model differences
   - Add VDP Model selection somewhere in GUI (useful for programmers).
   - VDP Model 315-5124: Doubled sprites bug (see Earthworm Jim)

 - Fix interrupt emulation and VDP control over the Z80 IRQ Line.
 - Other VDP Model differences (see Interactive Sprite Test, bug on SMS 1)
 - Palette
   - Support TMS9918 palette as on Japanese SMS (and Mark III)
     http://www.purose.net/befis/halloffame/msx_col/
   - Support TMS9918 palette from http://junior.apk.net/~drushel/pub/coleco/twwmca/wk961118.html
 - TMS9918
   - Render on a line basis to fix "Zoom Effect #1" demo (grr..)
 - Border emulation (this is a big miss)
 - Handle VRAM Accesses while refresh is ongoing (for programmers)
   See http://www.smspower.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=7849
 - Emulate sprite overflow (9th sprite) (VDP status bit 6 set). Should be fairly easy.

 TECHINFO APPLET
-----------------------------
 - Standardize names, registers names, etc.
 - Redo from stratch? Separate applets for different system components?

 DEBUGGER
-----------------------------
 - Bugs:
   - inst_after > pc-temp appearing in several cases (eg: Super Basketball demo).
   - Savestate/reset/bios seems to mess with breakpoints?
     Check coherency and switching between mainloops (emulation standard/debug, no emulation)
   - Backspace in memory editor widget reset machine
 - Debugger:
   - Console log: add full print history + a scrollbar.
   - Button to enable/disable exclusive focus.
   - Auto reload ROM option
     - Win32: possible to setup a notification
 - Disassembly
   - Option to display cycle count next to each instruction.
 - Breakpoint:
   - Add breakpoint from memory editor and/or disassembly window.
     - Simple version: click on disassembly window for breakpoint.
   - Conditionnal breakpoints:
     - Simple masking feature
     - Full expression evaluation/test?
     - At nop nop break (macro or helper).
     - Break at register write ?
   - Z80 read/execute are not perfectly differenciated (opcode 1st byte is X, then it is R)
   - Hooks:
     - VDP register/status
     - PSG/VRAM/dedicated break (per channel/address/tile/whatever).
     - Generally, much more possible things to add.
 - Datadump could be redirected to debugger console.
 - Small Bug (may not considered as one bug actually): Debugger ON, play, pause, debugger OFF -> machine gets unpaused.
 - Scroll thru disassembly
 - Completion
   - Better contextual completion, supporting per-command kind of parameter
     (eg: break cl[tab] -> clear)
     - Make the command line parser take additionnal flags, and be able to execute
       commands as well as just returning a list of words depending on the parsing
       context.
 - Profiling feature
   - Display line/cycles better
   - User settable timer, global cycle counter.
 - Print
   - Find a solution to the problem of not being able to print result that are not 16-bits
 - Symbols
   - Automatically select name/addr symbols find in "SYM" command
   - Keep track of source symbol, by keeping t_debugger_value all along the chain.
   - Figure out a way to keep symbol references and have them updated on ROM reload.
 - SET command
   - Access to non Z80 registers.
   - Indexing.
     eg: "set RAM[0] = 0"
 - MEMEDIT command
   - Specify address
   - Specify bus (standardize)
 - SEARCH command
   - Bytes/ascii search
   - Access to all kind of memory, once we have the proper abstract (see above)
 - VAR (?) command
    " As promised, here's my idea.
      v address var1 [var2 [var3...]]
      When execution reaches "address", the contents of var1, var2 etc are reported in the
      message window and execution is not stopped. var1 etc can be a register or an address
      in the Z80 memory map. In other words, it allows one to spy on parameters being passed
      to functions, as well as intermediate variable values inside functions, without having
      to set breakpoints and watch those values manually using memory dumps or the register
      display.
      Letter v is for "variable", since I can't think of a better letter to use. "
    - "wv" (watch variables) ?
 - Tilemap viewer:
   - Support vertical lock (gauntlet, golvellius...).
   - Proper support for extended modes requires resizing window (tilemap becomes 256*256).
 - SOURCE command:
   Load commands from a text file. Useful for storing per-project breakpoints.
 - Expression evaluator:
   - Unary operators -, !, ~
   - Proper operator priority. Currently two level: +/- gets low priority and 
     all other higher priority. Requires building a proper evaluation tree.
   - Access to data table RAM[0] (this gets more complex...)
 - Memory Editor:
   - Memory editor page focus is lost on ROM change.
   - Button to enable/disable exclusive focus.
   - 2/3 byte display/editing
   - Highlight edited digits, add backspace support
   - Dump button (calling datadump)
   - Edit ASCII
   - Lock a writing value
   - Show modified/written values. 
     How do I do that? Modified since when? Could be useful when stepping in code.
     - Use debugger hooks + highlight feature to show read/written values.
 - Memory find:
   - MEMFIND command.
 - Access to machine data in a standardized way (code/library for programmer,
   standardized syntax for end-user functionnalities)
   - 8/16-bits differenciation:
     - WLA DX uses nnnn.b and nnnn.w for ambigous opcodes on other CPUs
       Use a similar system to remove ambiguity!
   - Extract generic code to access memory blocks from memory editor, stick
     them in a generic interface in t_machine. Usable by memory editor, data
     dumper, debugger M command.
   - eg: registers: HL,AF,A, etc. memory: mem[HL]
   - User shortcuts. HL would be in fact cpu.hl ?
   - Z80 access:
    - Register edit
    - CALL command
      - Execute a CALL on the Z80, allow easy quick hack
      - Or more generally, allow inline instruction execution
   - Abstract Marat's core to be able to switch later.
   - Access to the previous state (automatic save state on each user step)
     - Require changing savestate code to work on a memory buffer.
   - User constructed GUI panels showing you info you want.
     Could display registers, any part of memory, tiles, etc.
     Allowing to create panels for custom debugging.
 - Input locker
   - Set input bits manually using check boxes, being able to set inputs 
     at any point.
 - Scripting
    - A breakpoint can trigger a call.
    - Support for debug configuration file/script per ROM/project.
 - Call Stack
   - Keep a call stack updated (using a modified Z80 core?)
   - Log wether each memory location was written as 8 or 16 bits?
 - Tools:
   - Sprite viewer
     - Select individual sprites, shows infos
   - Sprite ripper
     " One of the first modified versions of Gens included a sprite ripper. It would 
       examine the coordinates of the sprites, and when sprites lined up exactly it 
       would export them to a separate image. So long as a regular grid of 8x8 hardw
       are sprites is used to build up arbitrarily-sized character sprites (the 
       majority of games), this should work well. "
   - Cycle counter.
   - SDSC Debug Console.
   - Warn incorrect (non standard) VRAM/port accesses.
   - Warn interrupt if VDP latch is set (98% of the time I guess it
     can lead to a bug).
   - Warn on return of interrupts if Z80 registers are differents from entering (except shadow)
   - PSG access addresses logger/hacker
     Show checkbox for all location accessing to PSG, allows to disable some.
     Could be super useful for VGM hacking/logging.

-----------------------------
 PATCH
-----------------------------
 - Be able to reload MEKA.PAT in runtime (helpful for hackers), as a quick
   solution to the lack of features.
 - Add info about what's being patched (especially when using * as CRC).
 - Add IPS support.
 - Add ASM opcodes supports (-> embed an Assembler).
 - Start thinking about this feature in the bigger picture as a part of
   the debug/hack/cheat stuff. Avoid implementing 2 or 3 times to same 
   stuff in different components.

-----------------------------
 CHEATING
-----------------------------
 - Cheat entry database (equivalent to live .pat)
 - Action Replay SMS/GG
 - Game Genie GG
 - Persistant cheat database?
 - Cheat masters:
   - MugUK
   - Sweater Fish Deluxe
   - rouken (rouken AT bol.com.br)

-----------------------------
 KEYBOARD MAPPING
-----------------------------
 - Generally, hotkeys with ALT/CTRL are not a good idea
   (what does the above statement suggest? I don't remember now.. argh)

-----------------------------
 FILE LOADER / BROWSER
-----------------------------
 - Multi roms in single ZIP file support
   - At least, pick the biggest one with correct extension (the 'rom')
   - Warn user ?
 - Sort should give low priority to .ext -> "test.sms" before "test (jp).sms"
 - Still a problem with FB directory name load? (Don't think so.)
 - Key should work based on focus, to function even with SK-1100 enabled
 - Can "read names" made faster?
 - Different color/icon per system
 - Loaded ROM history
 - Global computer file database (to run a game from its ID/CRC/whatever)
   Then you can even imagine SMS Power! producing URL/links/datafile read
   by MEKA to run a given game from its museum page entry.
 - Mouse wheel handling should not set selection, just scroll.
 - Directory change notification:
   - [WIN] There's something, I know.
   - [LINUX] See SIGIO, linux/documentations/dnotify.txt

-----------------------------
 GUI
-----------------------------
 - Change resolution / video mode: need to interface in menus.
 - Fade: only 32-bits mode. supported
 - Font: Move the standalone tilde lower if possible (where does it apply? forgot)
 - Background filling is not correct is GUI resolution ratio is not 4:3
 - Switch fullscreen font to contains bold black+white
   (currently multiple draw pass are done, which is hell slow)
 - Leaks:
   - gui_box_delete() doesn't delete widgets
 - Documentation viewer
   - Add generic text viewer applet (that user can use to load his stuff).
   - Fix bouncing with pageup/pagedown
 - Move windows bug (press mouse 1, keep 2 pressed, release 1, etc..)
 - Online contextual help (using text viewer applet maybe?)
   - Eg: You would press F1 anywhere and it pop some info about the current 
     applet or widget focus.
 - Rewrite popup menu code
    - Menu moves instead of going off-screen (see non-english languages!)
      - Would be useful to use within windows (as a combo box)
    - Support for more than MAX_ENTRYS entrys
    - Support keyboard
    - Show Hotkeys
    - Multi part menus for like the big theme menu
 - Message box: load success/infos message order

-----------------------------
 GUI MENUS
-----------------------------
 - Consistant hotkey behavior.
 - Menu cleanup:
  - Add volume control.
  - Remove "screens"?
  - Messages:
    'Tiles Viewer' -> 'Tile Viewer'
    'Country' -> 'Region'
    'TV Type' -> 'TV Mode'
    'Fullscreen mode -> Game mode
    ?

-----------------------------
 TILE VIEWER
-----------------------------
 - Show everything in modes 0->3.
 - Mini bg/fg palette selectors in modes 0->3.
 - Zoom tile.

-----------------------------
 SC-3000
-----------------------------
 - Printer emulation
 - Tape drive emulation
   - Find out if encoding used in Music/Lode Runner/C_So! is standard
   - Common, do it. The world (and A.Wheeler) deserve it.

-----------------------------
 SF-7000
-----------------------------
 - Verify sprite collision on Gold Miner & Froggy ??
   - This crazy code seems to requires line-per-line collision detection on a TMS9918 mode!
 - Floppy disk
   - Correct way of handling disk swapping
   - Writeable disks (how good/bad does it works?), -> and, to file (need a policy or different extensions)
   - Write protection
   - Be able to create empty disk image
   - Disk viewer utility
 - Centronics port emulation
 - RS-232 port emulation
 - Sort out new SF-7000 disks
 - Find docs about the FDC

-----------------------------
 COLECOVISION
-----------------------------
 - May want to drop ColecoVision? Why adding more weight...
 - ROMs:
   - New Roms from MyColeco (gamepack + space invaders)
   - Sort out homebrewn coleco Roms
   - Just drop everything and import a GoodCOL set (or similar).
 - Check out Colecovision NMI fix from MESS
 - Check FLICKER for Colecovision roms: Antartic Adventure, Sewer Sam, Squish'em Sam
 - Problem with Dragon Fire savestate.
 - The Christmas demo is buggy because MEKA remove what it think is a footer (the ROM
   is not a 4k multiple and it's exactly +256 bytes, so my code think it is a footer)
 - Games:
    - Super Cobra display is off
    - Christmas needs to run in PAL/SECAM mode, without footer removing.
    - Donkey Kong: freeze after level 1
    - Fix Dragon Fire (see Dennis Stith, try Koleko 1.31)
    - Buck Rogers -> 5617
    - Fathom -> 7313
    - Space Panic -> sometimes freeze
 - Fix player 2 control
 - Add weird controllers emulation (make "Turbo" (coleco) works for Opi :)
 - Check cabellero bug reports

-----------------------------
 GAME GEAR
-----------------------------
 - Option to show entire effective screen
 - Option to stretch SMS size back to 160x144 screen. Figure out the pattern.
 - LCD persistance simulation
   (Super Monaco GP 2, Space Harrier, Ninja Gaiden)
   > Ninja Gaiden:
   > In 3rd act there are some flickering (windows on skyscraper).
   > In 2nd act, a strange "flying" & flickering sprite may appear (gunman).
   > Will there be more...? ;)
 - Gear-to-gear emulation.

-----------------------------
 ARCADE
-----------------------------
 - Emulate SMS arcade board (Opa Opa, Tri Formation, Solomon no Kagi)
   - The ports are figured out.
   - Need to figure out the dipswitches.
   - Add a proper interface.
 - Emulate SG-1000 arcade board (Champion Boxing, Champion Pro Wrestling)
   - Require encryption emulation.
   - Separare OPCODE read and DATA read in Z80 emulator (for encryption).
     That's useful anyway for debugger trapping.
 - Interface coin insertion.

-----------------------------
 BIOS
-----------------------------
 - Use external BIOS files.
   - Load from a given directory.
   - Implement hack (disablable) to remove cart checks within BIOS.
     This is not "accurate" emulation but much better for users.
     As long as it is disablable.
 - Implement port 3E properly.
 - Support for the different slots. How does the user work with that?
   I certainly don't want to make it "MesaDX complicated" for a gamer.
   Automatically select cartridge slot (or cart is ROM < 32 kb), and
   maybe allow a manual setup.
 - How would old savestate works once this is properly emulated?
   - Can we assert that games keep value stored in C000?
     - Replace the value?
   - Should maintain legacy emulation?
\ - Check Super Racing interesting boot code (hmm? it is an obsolete thought?).
 - Sort BIOS dumps.
 - Allow to boot up other machines (Colecovision/GG) without ROM.
   - Need to be able to select machine.

-----------------------------
 HARDWARE IO
-----------------------------
 - Port 3E
   - I/O (especially YM2413 could help Maxim's SMS VGM player)
 - Port F2
   - Bit 0 disable PSG/FM mixing?
 - Read from 0x7E on SG-1000/SC-3000 return a value based on R register.
 - I/O map differs between SMS1/SMS2/etc.
   - Wonder Boy in Monster World relies on that to distinguish them!
 - Check GG pirate cards menu dumps and emulate mapper
 - Implement horizontal counter latch.

-----------------------------
 MAPPER
-----------------------------
 - Move default MAPPER in driver structure (code)
 - Mappers emulation based on mask is incorrect if ROM is not power of 2
   and attempt to map a non existing page in a range MEKA think is ok.
 - Emulate 3-in-1 mapper (Master Games 1, etc..).
 - Emulate 0xFFFC bits to shift starting pages by a certain amount.
 - Check out Earthworm Jim / Arena cartridges for an EPROM?
 - SG-1000 RAM is only 2 kbyte
 - Check out Monaco GP 40k having Safari Hunting included - pirate cartridge?
   - Was figured out elsewhere. See dev forum post.
 - Check Flash / Desert Speedtrap cartridge -> the chip is 8kb!
   - Data should not be saved. DB directive?

-----------------------------
 SMS TESTS
-----------------------------
 - Write a program that print out at which line/cycle NMI "trigger".
   Can the bug I have in Fantastic Dizzy be reproduced on a real SMS with
   some bad luck, that is what I want to know. (Otherwise, seems like a Z80 bug.)
 - Write a program to be able to find out at which cycle/h-pos the h-scroll
   is latched. // Didn't Charles figured that out now?
 - Write a program that print R - can its 'period' be simulated better?
   - This is nonsense. Just implement a proper Z80 emulator and it'll do it.
 - Write a program to find original Rapid Fire speed/period.
 - Write a SMS program to figure out exactly which pixel are shown on GG 
   screen when is SMS mode (this has been discussed on SMS Power dev).

-----------------------------
 Z80 CPU
-----------------------------
 - Register R:
   - Investigate Rastan, register R (bit 7), use for bonus?
   - Differently emulated with different Z80 cores?
 - Implement a good Z80 emulator.
   - Common, do it.
 - Test with Zexall
   - http://www.mdfsnet.f9.co.uk/Software/Z80/Exerciser/
   - Proper SMS port. See forum.
 - Support Z80 overclocking -> increase iperiod for all lines, or only VBL
 - Try to implement Dayvee's Z80 emulator
 - Undocumented flags (ref: http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/cssfaq/tech_z80.html#UNDOC)
 - Proper iperiod pal/secam + CPU speed pal/secam!! (3.54689)
 - OUT (C), 0 variant
   http://www.smspower.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9412

-----------------------------
 SPEED
-----------------------------
 - Those should be calculated on frame rate:
   - Double-click speed
   - Message speed
   - Key repetition speed
 (currently using frame display counter, which is obviously bad)

-----------------------------
 MISC
-----------------------------
 - Detect empty overdump (00/FF). 
   It used to be ok with MekaCRC but not with CRC32.
 - Detect empty half (eg: 256 kb game with another 256 kb full of FF).
   This is often the case on some ROM chip. This would help ROM dumpers.
 - Display AUTHOR field from database (and others?).
 - Support for other compression format:
   - GZ
   - RAR
 - /_SYS_INFOS doesn't show correct OS version since Allegro is not yet installed
 - Remove SPACE problem in MEKA.CFG (and other files, maybe)
   - Can use new tools used by MEKA.NAM parser and add quotes to the sentences
 - Frame-per-frame (ALT-F12) done correctly (this is coder luxury...)
 - Be able to change pcx/, saves/ directories, etc.. with templates
 - Implement quizz. :)
   - Hardcode mode: need to answer a question to play.
 - Check Richard Bush' ASM Stuff (ooooold)
 - Static cartridge loaded (keep track of loaded cart when quitting).
 - Auto pause (pause when click on menu, etc..)
 - Command line parameter to start in fullscreen.

-----------------------------
 NETWORK
-----------------------------
 - Standard 2 player gaae.
 - Gear-to-gear with 1 GG on each side.
 - Sharing games, multi-games, SMS party project.
   - Need to cleanup a lot of side-effects, globals, determinism issues.

-----------------------------
 SAVESTATES
-----------------------------
 - Savestates slots showing with filled/empty boxes.
 - Thumbnails?
 - Press Fx and select slot. Much easier. Reuse that for blitter!
   - Generally, allow some kind of GUI widgets in fullscreen mode.
 - Format: add MEKA version field (text?)
 - Separate savestates in directory per system.
 - Message save + snail game/BIOS
 - Importer:
   - Frozen format (http://www.smspower.org/forum/messages/18383.html)
   - BrSMS format ?
 - Savestates manager
   - Scan/move everything. Avoid the plagging "renaming" problem.
 - Design a whole new, documented, shared, chunked savestates file format
   - This is the way to go.

-----------------------------
 MESSAGES / LOCALIZATION
-----------------------------
 - Add code to verify sync/order of message definitions & tables.
 - Switching to full multi languages:
   1. Switch to using TTF font.
   2. Cleanup fontsize dependant things / GUI code
   3. Implement non european language support (Japanese!) and add proper fonts.

-----------------------------
 GAMES NOTES
 Some may be obsolete.
-----------------------------
 - Safari Hunting: original cartridge has $4000-$BFFF unconnected,
   (allowing to use this area as a pseudo-random number generator ?)
   Check out if the game use this area and how.
 - Excellent Dizzy: Go-Dizzy-Go! attract mode screws up in MEKA.
 - Out Run: PSG noise leftover in FM mode.
 - Daffy Duck in Hollywood menus (verify on a real PAL/SECAM system)
 - Sangokushi 3: try to finds why demonstration is not the same as on a real system (R?)
 - Championship Hockey: reset, glitches ? See on real system.
 - Fix formula 1 !! ? (any moer problem?)
 - 20-em-1 timing problem (currently patched)
 - F-16 Fighting Falcon: keyboard two players mode? See MK3 Page
 - Rise of the Robots - raster ok? This game is too ugly for my eyes
 - Shining Force 2 bug :( try to play the game from scratch again
 - Sonic Blast in European mode
 - Why does Psycho Fox run in Japanese when keyboard is enabled ?
   - Well, it's safe to say that my country/D? ports emulation is a joke.
 - Hang On / Safari Hunt (cartridge, NOT bios) raster glitches are
   not located at the same place between SMS and Meka (timing?).
 - Cosmic Spacehead: verify scroll glitch during demo when switching scenes
 
 - (
    "European Prince of Persia has occasional minor graphical glitches 
     in 60Hz mode, but is still playable.
     Jungle Book has (from memory) more serious glitches in 60Hz mode."

     buggy Super Monaco Gp 1&2 are buggy when you turn right as far as you can
     go. some times nba jam will lock up and i dont think it is a jp game.
   )
 
-----------------------------
 SCREEN CAPTURE
-----------------------------
 - Advanced capture:
   - Set transparency png_set_tRNS().
   - Separate layers
 - Be able to map Screenshot to the pad, for opi and others.
 - Keep a way to use windows printscreen
 - Document PrintScreen weirdness in docs (NB-what weirdness?)
 - Add applet to configure everything (template/counter/automatic capture..)

-----------------------------
 CONFIGURATION FILE
-----------------------------
 - Document some things better:
   - Eg: "start_in_gui" is not mentionned anywhere!
 - Do a big cleaning/renaming/sorting of configuration variables.
   Some includes:
   - Current soundcard should be stored in meka.cfg as an ID string

-----------------------------
 NICE STUFF
-----------------------------
 - TV snow noise
 - Black & white TV mode
 - Screensaver
 - Blood layer have priorities over menus

-----------------------------
 DESKTOP
-----------------------------
 - Background filename should be case sensitive (especially for Mekanix)
 - Add ratio background stretch.
 - Unable to load pictures error only on start or theme switch (not when
   switching back to the GUI, everytime).

-----------------------------
 VIRTUAL MACHINE
-----------------------------
 - Clean up virtual machine handling.
 - Power light should be on on Sega Keyboard picture.
 - Find someone to draw nice looking systems.
 - Allows to show machine even with theme picture.

-----------------------------
 CONSOLE
-----------------------------
 - Error on first video init (init -> GUI|Fullscreen) should show in console.
   Currently, in WIN32, because Meka_State is not MEKA_STATE_INIT anymore,
   they show as a popup. The console was already killed anyway

-----------------------------
 ICONS
-----------------------------
 - Sort and add new icons to the executable.
   - All media icons from MEKA (SMS/GG/SG/SC games, etc)
   - Maxim's icon
   - Casiopea's icon
   - Golden Axe Warrior (amibe.ico in my e-mails)

-----------------------------
 SOURCES
-----------------------------
 - Sort machine_reset stuff, too many are done ?
 - Add pointer to reset for each drivers.
 - Improve the whole driver system.

-----------------------------
 SOUND
-----------------------------
 - Volume Control
 - Disabling sound:
   - Be able to disable sound within the program.
   - Support runtime /nosound switch (does not alter configuration).
   - With sound disabled, is emulation all the same ? 
     What about PSG/FM registers, saved into a savestate ?
 - WAV logging does not saves FM.
   - Require mixing on our side, or retrieval of mixed buffer.
 - Game Gear Stereo Emulation
 PSG:
 - Different PSG feedback/noise for SG-1000/SC-3000/etc.. (SN76489AN variant)
 - Higher PSG Volume
 - Enhanced PSG via samples (using Dave's idea) / or generating sinuses / other ways.
 FM:
 - Static sound in FM. -> kind of crackle. See sound/y's hiss.wav.
 - Add YM-2413 channel muting - and others things.
 - Be able to disable YM2413HD from compilation
 - Add ROMEO card support (yeah).
 - Instrument editor is obsolete.
 - Maxim tells me:
   > 3. Also, I updated to EMU2413 v0.60 and noticed that it sounds very
   > different, in particular the Phantasy Star title screen music where
   > the drums sound badly "clipped" as if played at too high volume.
   > Maybe you can check it out (EMU2413 is inside the MSXPLUG archive on
   > the author's website) and compare to a real system? I'm sure you're
   > interested in having the latest version for Meka :) Otherwise I can
   > send some in_vgm.dlls with the 0.55 and 0.60 cores.
 - Support CPU speed change.
 Notes:
 - Panning: possibility to support Game Gear stereo easily ?
   (without major performance hit)
 - AUpdateAudio() in starting init: it is necessary ?

 - Some (old) unsorted feedback:
 
   - "I have detected a error in PSG sound emulation in the game Sonic the
      Hedgehog (Sonic 1). The "ring" sound in the scene is 'consecutive' in
      real Master System, but in the MEKA is not."
   - Little Mermaid -> missing notes (MIGHT)
   - Games that have fast music: (verify)
     - Cool Spot (title screen, two different tempos)
     - Out Run
     - Sonic 1
     - Sonic Chaos
     - Strider
     - World Grand Prix, Engine noise has extra pitch also
     (maybe the guy was just a PAL freak, but better check)

   - "> Also, in Dynamite Dux, a soft beep sound can be heared when the music
      > of the first stage begins.
      I think I hear what you mean. Disable channel 2 and the noise channel
      and you can hear it alone, before any proper notes come in. I also hear
      a lot of crackling because of the vibrato-type effect it uses by changing
      the volume really quickly. If you listen to channel 1 or 3 alone then you
      don't hear it, so it's a Meka problem."
      - see Maxim e-mail
      - This is just the standard effect of the main sound bug described above.

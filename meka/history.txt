
This is the "developer" version of CHANGES.TXT
Not much difference, mainly:
- Including some source-related comments.
- Including pre-0.10 changelog.

Lines starting with ## are only pertinent on WIP releases, and should
removed when copying changes to CHANGES.TXT for a stable release.
They are usually of 2 kinds:
- Fixes or addition to things changed during WIP.
- Programmer/hacker centric information.

 MEKA 0.8x WIP Allegro 5
 -----------------------
  - Updated from Allegro 4 (software rendering based) to Allegro 5.2.40 (with OpenGL/DirectX backends).
    This required a lot of changes and rewrite in the codebase. It probably added new bugs,
    and performances seems to vary depending on computer settings and video drivers. [Omar, Maxim]
    Please do report if you have any issue/slowdown so we can fix them!
  - Rewrote sound engine and fixed audio issues that many users had. [Omar]
    The sound is also now functional under Linux and MacOS. [Omar]  
  - Changed default key mapping for Player 1 buttons to use Z/X. [Omar]
  - Setup panel allows to select display driver and resolution. [Omar]
  - Added Polish translation. [thr]
  - Updated Dutch translation. [Mark van Tilburg]
  - MacOSX:
    - Preliminary MacOSX port. MEKA NEEDS A MAC MAINTENER! [Omar]

    - VDP: Setting address via palette write preserve upper address bits. Fixes tests #4 and #15 of FluBBA's VDP Tester. [Omar]
    - VDP: Writing to palette sets the read buffer. Fixes test #10 of FluBBA's VDP Tester. [Omar]
  - Emulation (Audio):
    - PSG: Added support for Game Gear stereo emulation! [Maxim]
    - PSG: Emulate the PSG volumes "ideally" rather than matching some real systems' suboptimal output. [Maxim]
    - Emu2413: Fixed commands 0x26-0x28 from turning off the drums. [ValleyBell]
  - Emulation (Memory System, Mappers, Peripherals):

    - Fixed 32K "No Mapper" mapper from forwarding 3-D Glasses writes. Fixes '3D Gunner'. [Omar]
    - SMS/GG ROM images smaller than 48KB default to using no mapper. [Omar]
    - Hardware reset leaves RAM cleared with $F0 patterns on Japanese SMS.
      This allow 'Ali Baba' and 'Block Hole' to run properly. Better clearing patterns
      could be implemented for other systems/countries after we've done more research. [Omar]
    - Added support for mirrored VDP ports in $80..$BF range, as required by some 
      Korean games such as 'Pooyan', 'Sky Jaguar' or 'E.I.'. [Omar]
    - Light Phaser: Adding per-game hacky light phaser function to reduce drift 
      between perceived cursor and what the game will end up using, particularly 
      useful for 'Missile Defense 3-D' and '3D Gunner'. [Omar]
  - Emulation (SF-7000)
    - Added support for extended DSK format (as .dsk or .sf7 extensions). [Nanard]
      For future SF-7000 releases we will use this format as our legacy 163840 bytes .SF7 format
      didn't convey enough information to reliably emulate all available software.
  - Debugger:
    - Added support for setting breakpoint from ROM addresses (perform reverse mapping to validate address). [Omar]
    - Referring to a symbol using with the : prefix (in the form ":xxxx") returns the ROM address instead of the CPU address. [Omar]
    - Added STEPOUT command ("Continue to next RET* instruction at same stack-frame level."). [Omar]
    - Added STACK command ("Dump stack", with dual 8/16 bits display and with symbol resolving). [Omar]
    - Added VARS command ("Variables") to display content pointed by symbols in RAM. [Omar]
    - Added TRACE command to trace past execution. [Omar]
    - Improved the range of disassembly before PC cursor when running loops. [Omar]
    - Fixed CLOCK command display for period longer than 10 minutes. [Maxim]
    - Added support for parsing the bank in NO&GMB/WLA symbol format. Symbols are turned into ROM addresses. [Omar]
    - Added support for parsing SJASM symbol format. [Omar]
    - Added support for parsing TASM symbol format. [Omar]
    - Added a "Reload Symbols" menu option (useful when manually crafting symbols while reverse engineering). [Omar]
    - Added shortcuts button in interface for "Stop/Continue", "Step", "StepOver", "StepOut", "Stack". [Omar]
    - Disassembler: uses recorded Z80 execution history to allow semi-freely scrolling up and down in disassembly. [Omar]
    - Disassembler: display symbols given their full ROM bank mapping (if bank information is provided by symbols file). [Omar]
    - Disassembler: display symbols in 'RST xx' instructions. [Omar]
    - Disassembler: opcodes shown in lower-case, increased spacing for readability. [Omar]
    - Disassembler: display symbols+offset on JP/JR/CALL/RET/DJNZ instructions. [Omar]
    - Disassembler: display symbols on IX/IY indexed instructions given the current value of IX/IY. [Omar]
    - Disassembler: fixed issues with prefixed instructions. [Omar]
    - Improved disassembler view centering, increased the track-back buffer, fixed issues with prefixed instructions. [Omar]
    - Better support for 24-bits constants (for PRINT, etc.). [Omar]
    - Debugger is always available at runtime. Obsoleted /DEBUG command-line parameter. [Omar]
    - Debugger window can be resized. [Omar]
  - Tools:
    - CheatFinder: added a new cheat finder application. [Omar]
      - Can search for 1-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit values.
      - Can search in RAM,ROM,VRAM,VREG,PRAM,SRAM,Z80 spaces for maximum flexibility,
        although for actual cheat-finding purpose RAM is likely to be more searched for.
      - Reduce the match set by using ==,!=,<,>,<=,>= operators, compare with a constant 
        or the old value stored in each match memory location.
      - Highlight matches in the memory editor for easier visibility.
      - Undo button.
    - TilemapViewer: support for legacy graphic mode 2 used by SG-1000 games. [Omar]
    - TilemapViewer: support for 256x256 tilemap used in PAL/SECAM wide screen mode. [Omar]
    - TileViewer: support for showing full 16 KB range of tiles in legacy graphic modes. [Omar]
    - MemoryEditor: fixed editing of 93c46 EEPROM memory. [Omar]
    - MemoryEditor: fixed display of address when number of columns is not 16. [Omar]
    - Wav Logging: recording in Stereo. [Maxim]
    - Technical Information: added YM2413 information [Maxim]
  - GUI:
    - Disabled F10 key to quit emulator (regular ALT+F4 or OS close works). [Omar]
    - Now possible to resize the game window and some of the tools. [Omar]

    - Depth order of windows is preserved accross sessions. [Omar]
    - Increased mouse horizontal range when using scrollbars. [Omar]
    - Added 'game_window_scale' directive on configuration file to resize game window. [Omar]
    - Discontinued ALT+P (=F12) and CTRL+X (=F10) shortcuts. [Omar]
    - Added ALT+V shortcut to start/stop VGM logging. [Omar]

 MEKA 0.73 WIP 20080619
 ----------------------
  - Localization:
    - Updated Dutch localization [Mark van Tilburg]
  - SC-3000:
    - Fixed the ;/+/RAD key not working on Sega Keyboard emulation under
      certain host keyboard/OS configuration. Thanks Jacko. [Omar]
    - Fixed crash in the X86 assembly implementation of the 32KB RAM mapper
      writer when the upper 16 bits were not cleared by the Z80 emulator. [Omar]
  - Debugger:
    - Added "SYM @addr" command to search for symbols given an address. [Omar]
    - Added "RMAP addr" command to reverse map of a Z80 address and display
      the source of data based on machine state (mapper registers, etc). 
      eg:
        RMAP $8001      ; eg: print 'ROM $14001 (Page 5 +0001)'
        RMAP $E001      ; eg: print 'RAM $C001'
      The feature doesn't work 100% in all mappers & bus mirroring cases, 
      but should be ok with the standard SMS/GG mapper. [Omar]
    - Duplicate commands are automatically removed from history. [Omar]
    - Increased default height of the debugger. [Omar]
    - Changed watch point per-frame flood limit from 100 to 50. Will expose in 
      configuration file if requested. [Omar]
    - Fixed crash when loading symbols with debugger disabled. [Djbass,Omar]
    - Fixed labels showing one instruction early in "DASM" command. [Omar]
    - Added breakpoint '!' mark in disassembly window. [Omar]
  - GUI:
    - File browser: country flag now displayed even on BIOS, Prototypes
      or Homebrew images. [Omar]
    - Inputs configuration: right-click on input source selection goes 
      backward, in addition to regular left-click to go forward. [Omar]
  - Miscellaenous:
    - Added "Capture" menu with screen capture menu access and options. [Maxim]
    - Added "Capture All" mode, capturing all emulation frames to disk. [Maxim]
    - Added "Include GUI" capture option. Disable to only capture game screen 
      when MEKA GUI is enabled. [Maxim]
    - Renamed "Automatically crop and align screen captures" option to
      more explicit "Crop and align screen captures to 8x8 boundaries".
      Previous name was sounding too "cool" and was sometimes activated
      by innocent users who then got their capture all cropped. [Omar]
    - Added "screenshots_crop_scrolling_column" option in configuration
      file (default to enabled), to disable cropping the empty left-most 
      column in horizontally scrolling games. [Omar]
  - Project:
    - (Win32) Fixed standard libraries used by debug builds (using unusual
      combination led to various problems). Fixed various link warnings.
      Fixed shared directories between DLL and No DLL builds. [Omar]
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists. [Omar]

 MEKA 0.72
 ---------
  Includes all 0.72 WIP below, minus lines starting with hash characters
  (those lines refer to fixes relative to changes in a WIP).


 MEKA 0.72 WIP 20070512
 ----------------------
  - ColecoVision:
    - Removed detection of supposed 128-bytes headers and 512-bytes footers
      (from some old soft/copiers?), due to many false detections, 
      particularly on homebrew ROM images (the code was introduced in 2001 
      when Dig Dug and Pac-Man prototypes were released with such header, 
      but ROM images now circulating are without the header). [Omar]
      

 MEKA 0.72 WIP 20070508
 ----------------------
  - Ports:
    - Preliminary MacOSX port. [Proppy]
      Compile and run under a x86-based MacOSX system. Missing sound (due 
      to Seal) and debugger (unknown problem to resolve).
      Looking for someone who wish to improve and maintain this port.
  - Blitter/Video:
    - Fixed HQ2X stretched blitter when target output was not 16-bits. [Omar]
#   - Fixed TV Mode blitters broken since since switching to hi-color.
      Implementation is slower than previously, but it works well. [Omar]
    - Removed obsolete "scanlines" blitter, in favor of "tvmode". [Omar]
    - Stretching works on all blitters. [Omar]
    - Video depth, Vsync, Triple Buffering and Page flipping are now global 
      video settings, removed from each specific blitter. Greatly simplify 
      configuration and tweaking. [Omar]
    - Triple buffering doesn't interfere with the refresh is not supported
      by the current settings (eg: windowed mode), making it safe and more
      simple to always leave it enabled. [Omar]
  - CPU:
    - Z80: Fixed RETI behavior (same as RETN, copying IFF2 to IFF1). 
      Fixes pausing in SMS Robocop 3 during legal screens/introduction, 
      probably other infrequent cases. [FluBBa, Omar]
    - Z80: Accepting NMI doesn't copy IFF1 over IFF2, as suggested
      by Sean Young's "The Undocumented Z80 Documented". [Omar]
  - ColecoVision:
    - Fixed emulation of pending NMI, pending flag is cleared when
      reading VDP status. Fixes "Rock 'N Bolt" among other. 
      Thanks to the anonymous poster on SMS Power! forums. [Omar]
    - Note that the compatibility list for ColecoVision titles is
      severly outdated. At some point, James Carter worked on a new,
      more accurate list, but I lost all contact with him.
  - NES:
    - Fixed video rendering, broken when switching to hi-color modes. [Omar]
    - Added PRAM support in Memory Editor. [Omar]
    - Added 8 palette switching in Tile Viewer. [Omar]
    - Note: NES emulation is humor legacy code and won't be supported.
  - GUI:
    - Sorted default themes, removed non Sega 8-bit related themes.
      Now embedding background pictures in regular binary distribution. 
      CALL FOR NEW OR IMPROVED THEMES SUBMISSION! Please contribute.


 MEKA 0.72 WIP 20070426
 ----------------------
  - CPU:
    - Z80: Fixed cases were address arithmetic would not wrap in the 
      16-bit address space, effectively crashing the emulator (those cases
      were mostly happening on corrupted data, but it also legit Z80 code, 
      and in any case we don't want the emulator to crash). [Omar]
  - Tilemap viewer:
##  - Fixed leftover of white rectangle when mouse hover last line. [Omar]
  - Debugger:
    - Added "B nopnop" shortcut to break on two successives NOP instructions.
      This is basically equivalent to "B x =0,0". [Omar]
  - Miscellaenous:
    - Increased max length of directory/filenames. [Musuruan]
    - Added "Automatically crop and align screen captures" option.
      This option aligns screen captures on the nearest visible tile, 
      helping to simplify the process of creating game maps by pasting 
      captures next to each other. [Omar]
      Note: May not work properly on game using scanline based effects.
##- Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists. [Omar]

 MEKA 0.72 WIP 20061217
 ----------------------
  - Updated k.
  - Emulation:
    - Fixed data corruption/overflow in VDP emulation when seeking and
      writing to an invalid palette address. Thanks Maxim. [Omar]
    - VDP palette write do not mask out current VDP address, so performing
      the (unprobable) set address/access palette/access VRAM sequence will
      keep address in the full 16KB range. [Omar]
    - Fixed VDP line interrupts not properly running in overscan area in 
      224 lines mode. Fixes bottom of the screen in Charles Mac Donald's 
      BB2K6 demo. [Omar]
  - Video:
    - Changed default fullscreen blitter configuration in the hope of getting 
      something more compatible (640x480 by default), as so many people have 
      problems with fullscreen modes.
    - Got rid of "parallel" blitter that displayed both odd and even frame
      next to each other. Seems useless now. Could be brought back if some
      four-eyed person request it. [Omar]
  - Debugger:
    - Added CLOCK command, to display/reset a Z80 cycle counter.
      Very simple but can be helpful to time Z80 routines. [Omar]
    - (Win32) Forward debugging log to Windows debugging stream via
      OutputDebugString(), so running MEKA from Microsoft Visual studio 
      will display log in the 'Output' window. [Omar]
##- Project:
    - (Win32) Added new targets supporting shared standard libraries. [Omar]
    - Updated SOURCES.TXT documentation. [Omar]
##- GUI:
##  - Fixed background picture not loading on startup. [Omar]
    - Removed closing fadeout since the current implementation is way 
      inefficient and cannot garantee proper speed. [Omar]
##- Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists. [Omar]
##  Some particular renaming includes:

 MEKA 0.72 WIP 20051203
 ----------------------
##- GUI:
##  - Fixed bug with window closing button widget. [Omar]
##  - Fixed bug when quitting using the menu, configuration files were 
##    not saved. Thanks Jacko. [Omar]
##  - (Un*x) Fixed bug where menus would not clear themselves. [Omar]
##    (This was due to Allegro.h defining TRUE as -1 and a 1 value being
##    hardcoded in some part of the code).


 MEKA 0.72 WIP 20051120
 ----------------------
  - (Win32) Updated Allegro library from WIP 4.1.18 to 4.2.0, including
    various fixes/improvements:
        http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/onlinedocs/en/changes.html

          BREAK x =C9                   ; break on CPU execution of RET
          BREAK x =0,0                  ; break on CPU execution of NOP NOP
          BREAK w pram 0 =03            ; break on PRAM write of color 0 as red
      - Added display line event breakpoints/watchpoints. [Omar]
        Useful for debugging line interrupts.

 ----------------------
  - Miscellaenous:
##  - Fixed screenshots being fully transparent. [Omar]
    - Updated various tidbits in the configuration file. [Omar]
  - Development:
    - Added tilemap viewer. [Omar]
      - Shows tilemap, hovering or clicking a tile shows specific info 
        about it, allows filtering BG/FG, disabling tile flipping, display 
        of scrolling box, with or without raster effects, manual selection 
        of tilemap address, etc.
    - Cleaned Technical Information Viewer content, renamed a few fields
      to their official names, removed redundant information. It's not
      yet all clean. [Omar]

##  memory editor scrollbar crashing, etc.
  - Sources/Project
    - (Win32) Now linking to zlib.lib instead of zlibs.lib (name for standard
       static build of ZLIB). [Omar]


 MEKA 0.72 WIP 20050904
 ----------------------
  - Video:
    - Upgraded everything to hi-color video modes and got rid of old, 
      8-bit indexed video modes. This is a major change in MEKA core.
      Some of the benefits are:
      - No more snow and/or color flickering on video card drivers 
        which disliked palette changes.
      - Better integration with desktop (usually run faster).
      - Getting possible to use various kind of graphics filters.
      - No more hassle with color limitation for the programmer
        (meaning more features implemented for the end-user).
      - Finally possible to show all Game Gear colors at once, 
        and to implement LCD screen persistence (not yet done).
      Some of the features above goes hand to hand with the blitter
      system, which will be improved soon. [Omar]
  - GUI:
    - KeyPad Enter key now works on input boxes. [Omar]
    - Added shortcut CTRL-F4: closes current window. [Omar]
    - Added shortcut CTRL-TAB: cycles thru windows taking inputs. [Omar]
    - Reworked theme (skin) system from stratch: [Omar]
      - Changed MEKA.THM file format.
      - Using explicit names for variables.
      - Added more variables, making the skin system a little more 
        complicated but also more configurable.
      - Using de-facto standard of specifying colors in #RRGGBB format.
      - Rewrote most code since it was all legacy from old MEKA 0.10. 
  - Miscellaenous:
    - (Win32) Removed flickering from initialization message console. [Maxim]
  - Development:
    - Made '$' default prefix for hexadecimal values in various places. [Omar]
    - Datadump: [Ambil, Omar]
      - Fixed "palette" dumping. Blue and green components were inverted. 
        Replaced dumping of target host RGB values by actual SMS/GG components. 
      - Added sprite pattern base address in "sprites" dumping.
    - Memory Editor:
      - Added viewing and editing of VDP registers (VREG). [Omar]
      - Added configuration file directive for resizing window. [Omar]
      - Fixed cursor position when inputing an address on last page. [Omar]
    - Debugger:
      - REGS (R) command in debugger now display shadow registers as well. [Omar]
      - Added cursor before current instruction in disassembly. [Omar]
      - Added access to shadow registers in expression evaluator. [Omar]
        eg: 
          PRINT AF',BC',DE',HL'
      - Added SET command to modify Z80 registers. [Omar]
        eg:
          SET BC=$1234    ; set BC register to $1234
          SET DE=HL,HL=0  ; set DE=HL, then zero HL
      - Added MEMEDIT command to spawn a new memory editor. [Omar]
  - Sources/Project:
    - Removed password encryption from MEKA datafile (became useless). [Omar]
    - Fixed a bunch of warnings on higher warning levels. [Omar]
    - Hacked a lot of old GUI code (box, widgets, menus among others), cleaned
      and renamed various structures, replaced several usage of indexes by 
      pointers, added const qualifiers, rewrote parts of various applets, 
      got rid of some old obsolete code, etc. Hopefully broke nothing. [Omar]
    - (Win32) Fixed MSVC project to reference LIBPNGDIR.
    - (Win32) Including statically compiled libpng.lib in package. [Omar]
    - (UN*X) No more need to manually edit .ASM files to compile. [Omar]

 MEKA 0.71
 ---------
  Includes all 0.71 WIP below, minus lines starting with hash characters
  (those lines refer to fixes relative to changes in a WIP).


 MEKA 0.71 WIP 20050625
 ----------------------
  - Sources/Project
     - (Linux,DOS) Added 'BUILD' switch in Makefile to select between release 
        and debug builds.


 MEKA 0.71 WIP 20050624
 ----------------------
  - Now that MEKA is open-source, welcoming other developpers!
    - New contributor: Robert Raper (DjRobX)
    - New contributor: Maxim Stephin (MaxSt)
    Names between brackets refers to the person(s) involved in a change.
  - Blitter/Video:
    - Added triple buffering support on fullscreen blitters. [DjRobX]
      Made triple buffering the default for appliable video modes. It might
      or not work on all configuration. Please report if any problem arise.
    - Added max stretch support on fullscreen blitters. [DjRobX]
      This is currently only available on normal and HQ2X filter.
      Integer/ratio stretch not yet supported, so it is recommended to use
      a resolution multiple of the emulated system screen size.
    - Added support for internally converting the 8-bit video buffer to
      another video depth and blitting that. [DjRobX]
    - Integrated Maxim Stephin's HQ2X graphics filter, and added a dedicated
      blitter. Only 16-bits output is supported as of yet. [MaxSt,DjRobX]
  - Updated various tidbits of documentation. [Omar]
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists. [Omar]
    Some particular renaming includes:
      GG  - 7b7717b8 - Big War / Daisenryaku G (JP)         --> Taisen-gata Daisenryaku G (JP)

  Note that DjRobX's video/blitter changes were integrated but some features 
  may not be compatible with all others, and some need improvements. You are
  welcome to experiment different configuration settings in MEKA.BLT but not
  everything may work properly. The preset "HQ2X" blitter should works, though.
  
  The current blitter system makes it not trivial to do everything we want,
  it is too limited in configuration, and was first made with MS-DOS and low
  end computers in mind. As of next versions, I will work on reoverhauling the
  system, trying to better fits needs of the 21st century (resizing, multiple
  depth, hi-color, windowed modes without borders, non 4:3 ratio screens, 
  different refresh rates...) and improve ease of setupping. 
  Expect many changes in this area (hopefully). [Omar]


 MEKA 0.71 WIP 20050501
 ----------------------
  - GUI:
##   - Fixed text input widget insert mode, could not insert any character,
       and it broke memory editor (bug added in a 0.71 WIP) [Omar]
  - Development:
##   - Fixed replacement of 8-bit CPU registers variables (low and high 
##     nibbles were inverted) [Proppy]
     - Fixed display of CPU flags (only bit 0 was properly interpreted,
       because of a typo). Added display of undocumented flags bits 3 
       and 5 (partially emulated). [Omar]
     - Made it that debugger log to file is immediately flushed. This allows
       reading the log file in live while the debugger is running. [Omar]
     - Added REGS (R) command to dump Z80 registers to the log console. [Omar]
     - Added animation displaying weither CPU is running or not. [Omar]
     - Fixed behavior of step/step over/continue when executing while being
       located on a breakpoint. [Omar]
     - Fixed behavior of step over an infinite loop. [Omar]
  - Fixed loading of corrupted or incorrectly sized ROM images that would
    sometimes made the engine crash. [Omar]
  - Sources/Project
     - (Linux) Updated Makefile and some sources tidbits for proper compilation.
       [Omar,Belegdol,Proppy]
     - (Linux,DOS) Object directories are now created automatically. [Omar]
     - (Linux,DOS) Removed "smscheck" tool building from Makefile. Has nothing 
       to do with MEKA. [Omar]
     - (Win32) Make it that build date/time stamp in build.c is updated when 
       rebuilding the solution. Removed buildupd.exe executable from sources. [Omar]
     - (DOS) I'm stopping to maintain the MS-DOS port. A maintener is welcome. [Omar]
      
 
 MEKA 0.71 WIP 20050418
 ----------------------
  - (Win32) Added a "setup.bat" command file to run the interactive setup.
    Seems like few people were aware of the command-line option. [Omar]
  - (Win32) The interactive setup now offers to enable/disable the debugger,
    so you don't have to manually enable it. [Omar]
  - (Win32) Updated Allegro library from WIP 4.1.12 to 4.1.18, which includes
    various fixes/improvements:
        http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/onlinedocs/en/changes.html
  - (Win32) Fixed crash on early aborting (eg: command line error) due to non
    properly stopping joystick polling thread. [Omar]
  - Fixed input box widget missing keys on skipped frames. [Omar]
    This made key inputs very annoying on certain configuration, and 
    especially with 3-D glasses auto-frame-skipping enabled.
  - Fixed a problem losing focus while dragging GUI windows with certain kind
    of widgets (happened on tile viewer & memory editor, among other). [Omar]
  - Development:
     - Updated debugger documentation. [Omar]
     - Added symbol loading in NO$GMB format, as generated by the commonly
       used WLA DX linker (-s parameter). [Omar]
     - Added label/symbol viewing in Z80 disassembly window. [Omar]
     - Relative offsets are now resolved in Z80 disassembly window. [Omar]
     - Added expression evaluator. [Omar]
       Supports integer operators +,-,*,/, binary operators &,|,^, 
       parenthesis, symbols and CPU registers replacement. 
       Yet missing: unary operators -,!,~. 
       All commands uses the expression evaluator to get their numeric 
       parameters, so you can use it everywhere.
       eg:
         B function    ; break at given 'function' symbol
         M my_data     ; memory dump from 'my_data' symbol
     - Added PRINT (P) command to evaluate and print expressions. [Omar]
       eg:
         P IX,IY       ; print IX and IY registers
         P 1200+34     ; print $1234
         P %00101010   ; print 42
         P HL+(BC*4)   ; print HL+BC*4
         P label       ; print label
     - Added contextual command line completion. [Omar]
       Press TAB to complete current input with matching command/symbols.
       eg:
         b[tab]        ; -> BREAK
         b[tab]la[tab] ; -> BREAK label
     - Added SYMBOLS (SYM) command to list and search for a symbol. [Omar]
     - Changed breakpoint/watchpoint range syntax to '..' to avoid any
       syntaxical ambiguity with substraction (eg: B 1000..2000). [Omar]
     - Added "B ENABLE/DISABLE ALL" shortcuts to enable/disable all 
       breakpoints at once. [Omar]
     - Added "B CLEAR DISABLED" shortcut to clear disabled breakpoints. [Omar]
     - Added "Reload ROM" functionnality in the debug menu, for quicker reload.
     - Palette viewer now shows color entry data while hovering colors. [Omar]
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists. [Omar]
    Some particular renaming includes:
      SMS - 60c19645 - Akai Koudan Zillion (JP)             --> Zillion / Akai Koudan Zillion  (note: this ROM was released in both Japan and Europe)
      SMS - a1710f13 - Lucky Dime Caper, The                --> Lucky Dime Caper, The - Starring Donald Duck
      SMS - 5718762c - Zillion                              --> Zillion (US)

 MEKA 0.70                 Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -

  - Released source code.
    Added SOURCES.TXT file with some information for programmers.
  - Registration key is a thing of the past. It never served a real purpose
    other than identifying donators. All donators are publicly listed at:
        http://www.smspower.org/contrib.htm
    Big thanks to all of them for their great and useful support!
    I'll keep sending news/e-mails to donators.
    MEKA is now officially not having a registration procedure anymore, but
    your donations are still greatly welcome and are helping me to cover a 
    part of my never-ending Sega 8-bit expenses, including buying cartridges
    for dumping and preservation purpose.
    I updated documentation to reflect this, and changed occurences of the
    "registration" word by "donation", as it was always meant to be anyway.
  - In SMS mode, fixed color filling when VDP rendering is disabled. 
    Previously disabled parts where filled with black, instead of the current 
    border color. No commercial game exhibited the problem. Chris Covell's 
    port of Aleste 2 from GG to SMS did.
  - Disabling background display now shows a yellow-ish color instead of the
    black/border color, to help sprite ripping. Sorry it's not FF00FF pink,
    but I am currently lacking free palette entries, and anyway, a screen full
    of FF00FF pink would damage your eyes in a matter of seconds. :)
  - Development:
    - Added new full-featured breakpoints and watchpoints!
      - Manage multiple breakpoints/watchpoints. Add/remove/enable/disable.
      - Break and watch on CPU (rwx), IO (rw), VRAM (rw) and PRAM (w) buses.
      - Break and watch on specific access (read/write/execute).
      - Break and watch on single address or whole range.
      - Add description to breakpoints/watchpoints (this is not very useful
        right now, but it will be come handy in later version).
      - Previous "B" command changed to "S" (step over).
      - Previous "B xxxx" command (one-time breakpoint) is still accessible
        using the "C" (continue) command.
    - Added detailed help for each command.
      (eg: "HELP B" to get help on breakpoints).
    - Added DEBUGGER.TXT file with help and summary of debugging features.
    - Instruction flow disassembly now attempt to display instructions before
      the current one, based on some magical voodoo technique of mine.
      Don't expect it to work in all cases - it is theorically impossible to 
      do with variable-sized instructions anyway - but it can be improved.
      This feature helps figuring out what's being executed contextually.
    - The current instruction is now highlighted.
    - ROM edition in the memory viewer was not taken into account without
      a hard reset in region 0x0400-0x3FFF. Fixed.
    - Fixed savestate saving/loading which didn't restore scanline number
      properly, affecting debugging using those features.
    - Tile viewer now display tile starting address.
    - Tile viewer now update information while mouse hovering.
    - Added optional length parameter to "MEM" and "DASM" commands.
    - Fixed ASCII display of memory in "MEM" command.
    - Added "debugger_console_lines" and "debugger_disassembly_lines" 
      variables in configuration file, allowing to change debugger size.
      Combine with a high-resolution MEKA desktop, and you can't be unhappy.
    - Added debugger session logging to file "debug/debuglog.txt".
      Can be disabled by clearing "debugger_log" in configuration file.
    - Fixed a bug using the memory editor to write to RAM in Coleco Vision mode.
    - Hacked a way so that you can affect controller inputs data while debugging
      (press a direction, it immediately apply on the emulated system state).
    
  - When used in the interface, analog peripherals supported by the mouse now
    only perform their action if the mouse has focus on the game window. 
    This prevent accidental in-game shooting when using tools or debugging.
    Of course, you should not use the interface if you only intend to play.
  - Fixed /LOG command line parameter (broken recently).
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
    Redumped more games, sorted more versionning/country confusion.
    To avoid certain confusion, all Game Gear games originally running 
    in Master System mode were moved back in the Game Gear section. 
    This makes the list consistant with actual cartridge releases.

  [Sources]
  - Scrapped back all Arnosan shame crap.
  - Added per-line color setting to textbox widget.
  - Messed with the terrible box/widget code that vaguely ressemble to something
    related to focus handling. I needed some change to support hovering in the
    tile viewer... hope I did not break anything...


 MEKArnosan 0.69b         Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Mekarnosan special release, dedicated to Mr Arnosan, idol among the idols!


 MEKA 0.69b               Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -

  - [DOS/UN*X] Fixed ZIP file support which was accidently disabled 
    in version 0.69.
  - Improved auto frame-skipper precision by a minor amount.
    (on another hand, it still manage to skip frames badly).
  - Disabled keys 0 to 9 to set a save state slot directly. 
    Those conflicted with some existing and future features.
    Hope that noone will be annoyed!
  - Added ALT-ENTER hotkey to switch between fullscreen and windowed drivers.
    It works in both GUI and Game mode, although the setting is not saved in 
    Game mode (due to the way the MEKA.BLT file works now). 
  - Added an option to allows pressing opposite directions on the joypad.
    Although standard SG/SMS/GG controllers do not allow that, certain
    type of controllers (or a modified or broken one) may allow it. 
    This serve the purpose of demonstrating a bug in "Wonder Boy in Monster 
    Land", where pressing Left and Right on the same time confuses the game.
    It is also useful in the case some creative genius SMS programmer would
    want to take advantage of that weird feature to do unusual things for a
    soon-to-be released SMS software.
  - Fixed priority of Sega Keyboard (SK-1100) emulation, so that not colliding
    hotkeys are still available while SK-1100 is enabled.
  - Memory Editor now share inputs focus with game. It makes hacking easier.
    Of course you can always pause (F12) or remap controls if needed.
  - Fixed state of debugger window (bug introduced in 0.69).
  - Updated translations:
    - Dutch translation (by Mark van Tilburg).
    - Swedish translation (by Henrik Sankala).
    - Redneck translation (by some redneck in UK).

  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.

  - Updated k.
  - Updated documentation.
  - Added a Memory Editor, long awaited by programmers, hackers and cheaters!
    It allows reading and writing to Z80 memory map, ROM, RAM, VRAM, Palette
    and Battery Backed RAM. Although it is not yet full-featured, it is 
    already very possible to create your own Pro Action Replay codes, and 
    perform various real-time hacks. 
    Please share your questions and hacks on SMS Power forums:
        http://www.smspower.org/forum
    This tool is the result of joint work with my beloved girlfriend, who
    submitted a first version of it that she developped.
  - Added support for loading and saving pictures in PNG format. PNG is now 
    the default format for screenshots, instead of the badly outdated PCX.
    (thanks to libpng). 
  - Screenshots are now saved in the "Screenshots/" subdirectory.
  - Tweaked some themes, reordered them, removed a few. Themes backgrounds 
    are now in PNG format. Please be sure to download the new picture pack at:
        http://www.smspower.org/meka/themes
  - [Windows] Added a message console that shows up on startup and magically
    disappear before you have time to read anything. If any problem occurs,
    the console will actually stay to let you read it.
  - [Windows] Fixed runtime application icon that wasn't showing.
  - [Windows] Removed command line parameters uppercase conversion (eg: when 
    ran from Windows explorer). This inconveniently created uppercase output 
    filenames for savestates, screen captures, etc. This was MS-DOS legacy.
  - Slighty optimized VRAM accesses emulation.
  - Incremented message buffer size to cope with SMS Chip-8 Interpreter 1.1
    11k embedded comment. There is still buffer overflows in the code and
    I'm not trying to fix most of them now, so this is just a work-around.
  - Various other fixes and code tweaking.

  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.

 MEKA 0.68b               Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -

 As an experiment, I have enabled vsync in all default blitters and enabled
 it by default in the GUI. Blitters are still a bit complicated to configure
 so few people seems to actually tweak them or even enable the "smooth" 
 blitter. Does it works better for you?
 I'll be working on synchronisation and blitter improvement (stretching...)
 in the future.

// Frameskipper and FPS computation changes makes this a test build.
// MEKA now requires at least a Pentium CPU, due to usage of the RDTSC
// instruction. I doubt that anyone still used a 486 anyway.
// If nothing if broken due to those changes, I will be working on a new way
// to perform throttling and frameskipping.

//  - Tweaked the auto-frameskipper a little. Notify me if you notice any new
//    problem. The auto-frameskipper still eats most CPU and isn't very good.
//    Removed asynchronous events for FPS computation, the less they are, the
//    more happy is the CPU.
  - Removed the 2-byte tolerance in overdump detection. Overdumps with two
    slighty different half will be added in the database and marked as bad.
  - Emulation:
     - Fixed a major bug in the driver system, which resulted in corrupted
       savestates in F-16 Fighter / F-16 Fighting Falcon (the savestate
       system recognized them as SG-1000 games and so saved only part of RAM).
       Previous ingame states for the game are unrecoverable :(
     - Removed immediate palette update when CRAM is written in a legacy
       video mode (the palette isn't updated on a SMS). It only affected
       F-16 Fighter / F-16 Fighting Falcon, but in a non game-visible way.
     - Tweaked heuristical SMS/GG mapper detection.
     - Fixed SMS/GG scanline counter emulation which was ignoring TV type 
       (NTSC or PAL/SECAM) override directive from the database.
       (eg: one game would be forced to PAL/SECAM mode, but scanline counter 
        emulation still mimic an NTSC system if it is the user selection).
  - Fixed mouse button mapping in the Input Configuration applet.
  - Fixed file browser showing Japanese names after loading SMS Woody Pop
    or GG Pop Breaker (why those games only? because they both have a default 
    country information in the DB, as they only works on Japanese systems).
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
    Some particular renaming includes:
      GG  - Ganbare Golby! (JP)             --> Ganbare Gorby! (JP)

 Please report any problems you encounter. 
 Suggestions are always welcome.

  - Updated MEKA.NAM database with a new format. 
    The new format is more robust, includes CRC32, additionnal flags, and 
    allows specifiying multiple countries for a same ROM file.
    In addition, while the MEKA database is being repopulated with entries
    in the new format, a high amount of verifications are being done on a
    case by case basis (redump, verified name based on original game media,
    box and manual, analysis of different versions of a same game, etc...).
    I have already redumped more than a hundred games. This will unsure 
    having a near-perfect database after the transition. Old formatted 
    entries are kept during the transition period.
  - SMS-mode Game Gear games are now autodetected and forced to run into
    SMS mode even with a .GG extension. This is because those games are
    often spread with a .GG extension, although there is no way in software 
    to distinguish between a native GG game and one running in SMS mode, 
    since the selection is done via a connected pin in the cartridge itself.
  - Updated file browser:
      - Added dedicated icons to known bad dumps, BIOS images, unofficial
        hacks, homebrew programs (also incorrectly called "public domain"), 
        prototypes and unofficial translation. A translation is defined as 
        a hack whose primary purpose is to alter the language of a game.
        How do you like my icons? 
      - Added European, German, Italian, New-Zealand, Portuguese, Spanish,
        Swedish and United-Kingdom flags. All flags are now displayed with 
        a border, because some themes may choose a window color matching 
        some flags.
      - The "Load Names" feature is now faster and does not verbose any
        data to the message box while loading all files.
      - Made file browser window bigger by default.
      - Removed the auto-generated MEKA.VFN file, which was crap anyway.
        Instead, added a new auto-generated MEKA.FDB file, which store 
        association between user ROM file names and MEKA DataBase entries.
  - Emulation:
      - Emulated VDP 315-5124 behavior of using register 5 bit 0 and 
        register 6 bits 0-1 as masks on sprite x/tile attributes address 
        and tile index. No known game relies on this feature, but it is 
        good for the sake of accuracy and for developpers to check against
        this particularity in their code (it is often a coding mistake). 
        VDP 315-5124 must be selected for that.
  - Updated TECH.TXT with SMS controller pinouts, simple SMS/DB-9 controller 
    adapter instructions from Gary Pierce, and GNU/Linux notes.
  - Various other fixes and code tweaking.

  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
      - Naming and database field usage convention has been changed, 
        based on the new format. 
        - "Title (The)" now becomes "Title, The".
        - Unless specified by the game title, "Name: Subtitle" now 
          becomes formatted "Name - Subtitle".
        - A few other things related to versionning/country.
      - Replaced all instances of "Tectoy" by "Tec Toy".
      - Added some missing accents.
      - Added many missing subtitles.
      - Added many new product numbers.
    Some particular renaming includes:
      SMS - Alex Kidd BMX Trial (JP)        --> BMX Trial - Alex Kidd (JP)
      SMS - Ninja Gaiden [B]                --> Ninja Gaiden

      GG  - Winter Olympics                 --> Winter Olympics (JP)
    The list above doesn't include ALL renaming, but only those I felt are
    the most important to be propagated. Many other renaming were done.

 [Private Changes]
  - Rewrote DB system.
  - Rewrote VLFN system.
  - Cleaned file browser.
  - Rebuild datafile with new data.


 MEKA 0.67                Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -

  - Updated documentation.
  - Tweaked the auto-frame skipper. Please let me know if you notice any
    improvement or new problem.
  - The analog Paddle Control is now usable using a digital keyboard or
    joystick input, although it is HIGHLY recommended to use a mouse.
    Playing with a keyboard or joystick may be sometimes frustrating and
    does not allows fast movements.
  - Updated debugging mode:
      - Scrapped old, buggy, and unusable MS-DOS only text mode debugger.
      - Added new debugger, well integrated into the GUI and functionnal 
        with all versions of MEKA. It is a primitive debugger, but it can
        be helpful and it is definitively better than nothing.
        Supports step-into, step-over, breakpoint, jump, disassembly and
        memory dump. Expression are not evaluated and syntax is primitive.
        Enable with the /DEBUG command line parameter.
      - [Windows] Data dumping facilities are now working.
  - Updated patching system (see MEKA.PAT file):
      - Updated syntax.
      - Support for long awaited RAM patches! 
        One of the side effect to that is that you can now apply 
        PRO ACTION REPLAY codes easily. This feature is unfortunately
        not backuped by a full-featured interface and cheats database, 
        but is helpful and better than nothing - while waiting for 
        advanced cheating functionnalites to be added in the future.
      - Support for CRC32 to specify the game to apply patches on,
        as well as using MEKA proprietary checksum format.
      - Putting * in the CRC field will apply a patch to all games.
      - Minor bug fixes.
  - Inputs:
      - [Windows] Fixed joystick sliders support (DirectInput < 8.00 
        usually reports the fourth and fifth axis of a joystick as 
        being sliders, which is a weird little known behavior).
      - File browser now takes exclusive inputs so the emulated game
        is not affected by keypresses.
  - Fixed file browser "Load Names" feature. It was broken in version 0.66,
    and sometimes (not always) went into an infinite loop in earlier version.
  - [Windows] Command line parameters help is now displayed in a message box.
  - Closing a box now automatically focus the next one in focus order.
  - Various other fixes.
  - Updated Dutch translation (by Mark van Tilburg).
  
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists,
    on the road to perfection. Added many missing (J) flags in the Game Gear 
    compatibility list. Added a few missing accents.
    Some particular renaming includes:

 Blitting & synchronisation are still very bad in many cases. This is my
 top priority but I still cannot find a good solution to improve it and
 please everyone (slow and fast computers). I can't sleep! :(
 Use the "smooth" blitter if possible.

  - Updated default blitters (MEKA.BLT).
  - Video mode is not reinitialized anymore when switching blitters with
    the same resolution/refresh rate. This saves a bit of time.
  - [Windows] Fixed page flipping, for those using it (see MEKA.BLT file).
  - [Windows] Sega 3-D Glasses support is now properly working in MEKAW!
    If you build the simple 3-D Glasses to COM adapter (as described in
    the TECH.TXT file), it is possible to plug original 3-D glasses and
    enjoy 3-D games as they were meant to be played - and additionnally, 
    damage your eyes due to intense flickering :)
    Best results are achieved by enabling page flipping or vsync.
  - [DOS] Sega 3-D Glasses support now also works under a Windows 95/98
    command prompt.
  - Increased maximum number of joystick buttons to 32 (instead of 16).
  - Partly fixed incorrect joystick axis reporting. It was a problem for 
    many people, and made it impossible or difficult to configure joysticks
    using the interface. One extended joystick axis may be missing now, 
    until I can find a solution to this other problem.
  - Tile viewer can now be configured to displayed all 512 tiles, instead
    of the first 448 only. The bottom tiles looks awful with most SMS/GG 
    games but some games use this area so it's good to see them.
  - Tile viewer now allows to select all 15 colors to display tiles in
    TMS9918 video modes (used by SG-1000, SC-3000, Coleco Vision, etc.).
  - Loading a ROM now display the full name in the message box.
  - [Windows] Upgraded MSVC compiler from version 5.0 to 7.1 (might bring
    a small improvement on performance). Removed ZLIB.DLL from the 
    distribution and statically linked it to the executable.
  - [Windows] Fixed mekaw.cfg saving location. It was saving in a wrong
    place in some cases (depending how you run it). 
  - Updated Danish translation (by Mark Klemp).
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Fixed Z80 interruption timing.
    I have tested several "sensitive" games and nothing should have been
    broke, but please e-mail me if you notice anything unusual.
    In addition, the fix allowed to remove the need for a custom parameter
    in MEKA.NAM for 5 more games.
  - Fixed MEKA.PAT which added a bug to pausing in Wonder Boy III [SMS].
    The bug was a leftover of one of my working session, and I forgot to
    remove it before releasing the official distribution of version 0.65b.
  - Fixed user inputs during the next frame after loading a savestate.
    Previously, they were reseted on savestate loading, meaning that your
    inputs were ignored on the first 1/60th second after loading. Although
    this is not dramatic in most cases, in a few it made savestates unusable
    because the player would die on loading without being able to react.
    Now you have that missing 1/60th second.
  - Attempted to fix the occasionnal crash on shutdown. I don't know if it
    happens anymore or not.
  - Updated Swedish translation (by Henrik Sankala).
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
    Some particular renaming includes:

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Updated k.
  - Fixed TV Mode which was accidentaly broken in version 0.65 (due to
    recent palette system rewrite). Sorry for the inconvenience. I also
    took the occasion to slighty optimize it.
  - Fixed still screens corruption in Game Gear version of "Bart vs. the
    Space Mutants". It was affected by a timing issue introduced in a
    previous version. The fix (using a MEKA.NAM feature) is temporary until
    a better one can be found.
  - [Win] Added a simple first-run setup screen, to select soundcard,
    sample rate and language. Additionally, you can show the setup screen
    on startup by passing the -SETUP command line parameter to MEKA.
  - Added "cabinet_mode" setting in MEKA.INP, to invert ESCAPE and F10 keys.
    Arcade/emulation cabinet owners often have ESCAPE mapped to a key they
    want to use to quit. This feature is a quick addition until full key
    redefinition is supported.
  - Added auto-repetition on keys F6/F8 (savestate selection).
  - Added support for mouse wheel in file browser and documentation viewer.
  - Fixed state saving crash that could happen when sound is completely 
    disabled and no FM emulator was selected.
  - Started migrating from my own general purpose C library to standard
    C library (LibC) for various functions.  This should provides speed
    improvements in the initialization process.
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
  - Various minor changes. Can you stop them all?
  - [Unix] Fixed configuration file saving.

  [Sources Changes]
  - Toyed with Z80 core and added interrupt logging facilities.
    This can be useful for debugging purpose when you can replicate the
    same execution.

  - Rewrote palette system in the attempt of reducing palette changes
    even more. As some people noticed, on some computer, the Windows
    version had terrible slowdown and incorrect colors at some occasion
    and especially in Game Gear games.
    This is due to some DirectX video drivers which force waiting for
    a screen refresh before each palette change. Problem is that some
    drivers does that and some other do not. Palette changes in MEKA
    are now better grouped so that the wait should not affect gameplay
    in most cases.
    Please report if you notice any palette related problem in this version.
    Windows users, note that you can still get color flickering in some
    video modes. But overally, things should be much better.
  - Rewrote hardware sprite collision emulation for video modes 1, 2 and 3
    (used by SG-1000/SC-3000/SF-7000/Coleco Vision software, mainly).
    Sprite collision are now processed line per line, for a very accurate
    result - at the cost of a slighty slower emulation. Although machines
    using those video modes usually can't poll for the current line, some
    software can manually do a similar job, making this precise value useful.
    This fixes "Froggy" and "Gold Miner" (SF-7000), and maybe more.
    Please report if you notice any collision related problem in this version.
  - Fixed SMS/GG scanline counter to return accurate values.
  - PAL/SECAM modes now have 313 lines instead of 312.
  - Fixed "Daffy Duck in Hollywood" (SMS) which in some cases had
    incorrect scrolling on the level score screen.
  - Fixed palette switching in "F-16 Fighter" / "F-16 Fighting Falcon",
    colors were incorrect during one single frame after the title screen.
    This bug was introduced in a previous release.
  - [Windows] Fixed screen capture (did crash with some DirectX drivers
    in version 0.64c).
  - Added Chinese flag in the file loader and associated the early dump
    of Hokuto no Ken with it.
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
    Fixed a few inconsistent entries.
    Some particular renaming includes:
      Chase H.Q.        --> Taito Chase H.Q.        (official name)
      Story of Mio      --> Hoshi Wo Sagashite...   (official name)
      Hokuto no Ken [B] --> Hokuto no Ken
      Hokuto no Ken [A] --> Hokuto no Ken [China]
  - Updated documentation.
  - [UN*X] Released a quick & dirty GNU/Linux build, codenamed "MEKANIX".
    It is not perfect and I do not plan to completely support it, but I hope
    it can be useful to some people (some asked for it).
    Please read MEKANIX.TXT if you want to use it.

  [Sources Changes]
  - Started updating several files to meet a standardized coding style
    accross the project. Various changes and clean-ups.


 MEKA 0.64c               Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Fixed the bug that would sometimes shut down sound when resetting
    or loading a savestate in full-screen mode.
  - Fixed the bug that would not save battery backed memory when switching
    the virtual machine Off (thanks Ian Hodgkinson for the precise report!).
  - Fixed Light Phaser border limit when left column is blanked. In some
    cases, the limit was enabled where it should not have.
  - Light Phaser is now usable inside of the GUI, although this is obviously
    not recommended since you can move the game window accidentally.
  - Redumped and verified plenty more cartridges. Added and modified entries
    to the checksum and compatibility lists, including new alternate dumps.
    Some particular renaming includes:
      James Bond 007: The Duel [B] --> James Bond 007: The Duel
      James Bond 007: The Duel [A] --> James Bond 007: The Duel [Brasil]
      Paperboy [B]                 --> Paperboy
      Paperboy [A]                 --> Paperboy [USA]
    Also modified compatibility list to be coherent with checksum list
    regarding alternate version naming.
  - MEKA now switch back to interface if fullscreen video mode cannot be set,
    instead of quitting.
  - Virtual machine picture positionning in the GUI now takes account of the
    resolution (in GUI another resolution than default 640x480 is used).
  - Updated history section of the documentation.
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
  - [Windows] Fixed some of the screen corruptions when another application
    is getting the focus or writing to the screen (untested).
  - Added SG-1000 games to the multiplayer games list file (MULTI.TXT).
  - Updated Danish translation (by Marc Klemp).
  - Added CPU state dumping feature in debug mode.

  - Added patches to be able to run SMS BIOS images (Alex Kidd in Miracle
    World, Hang On / Safari Hunt, Sonic the Hedgehog...) as standard games.
  - Fixed an amazingly stupid problem that's been around since years, which
    was that Game Gear colors were considered as 9-bits instead of 12-bits.
    Colors are now more precise, and you can notice a clear difference by
    looking at the ground in FIFA International Soccer.
    Thanks goes to Carleton Handley (the FIFA programmer on Game Gear) for
    clearly pointing that out to me.
  - Fixed VDP IE1 bit controls on Z80 IRQ Line.
  - Fixed top of the screen in video mode 3, and optimized its refresh.
    (used by Cabbage Patch Kids Picture Show and Smurf Paint & Play Workshop)
  - Added Danish translation (by Marc Klemp).
  - Patches write commands (in MEKA.PAT) now support multiple bytes in
    a single line.
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
  - Added "Skydrop" theme by Peter Deas (need to uncomment it in MEKA.THM).

 Important changes were applied to the sound engine. As always, please
 contact me if notice something unusual, if you have any comment or doubt.

 PSG fixes that were applied in version 0.63 are apparently causing a bug
 to Out Run (SMS) running in FM mode. I searched but was unable to fix it
 as of yet. :(

  - Cleaned and modified various part of the sound engine.
    Please report if you notice anything unusual.
  - [Windows] Disabled access to hardware YM-2413 emulation using OPL
    under Windows 2000 and XP, avoiding crashes in certain cases... Well,
    this time it should works :-)
  - [Windows] FM Sound through OPL is now muted when switching to other
    applications. PSG can not muted yet due to a technical constraint.
  - Fixed muting of OPL on pause and quit (previously you were sometimes
    able to hear very low hanging notes with a very high volume).
  - Implemented software YM-2413 emulator by Mitsutaka Okazaki.
    Although hardware YM-2413 emulation using OPL sounds cooler, this
    emulator seems more faithful to the original chipset. It also works
    on all systems, including Windows 2000 and XP. The downside is that
    doing software synthesis takes a lot of time, and thus a fast computer
    is recommended (at least 600 Mhz) to play MEKA with software YM-2413
    emulation.
  - Implemented a new software PSG emulator by Maxim (with modifications).
    PSG emulation is pretty straightforward, but this emulator takes
    account of several Maxim finds, such as the real sequence of pseudo
    random numbers, as generated by the noise channel.
  - Added refresh rate settings to GUI and Blitters. An advanced user
    can now setup a video mode at 60 Hz with vsync enabled and auto frame
    skipping disabled, for a smooth video refresh.
  - Fixed PSG output that was previously too low and unsigned.
  - [Windows] Attempted to fix some crashes subsequent to freeing a ROM.
  - Added entries to the checksum and compatibility lists.
  - Updated documentation.


 MEKA 0.63b               Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - [Windows] Disabled access to hardware YM-2413 emulation using OPL
    under Windows 2000 and XP, avoiding crashes in certain cases.
  - Removed rare PSG debugging messages that were accidentally left.
  - Fixed timing of the {LD,CP,IN,OT}[ID]R transfer/comparaison Z80 opcodes,
    which were made too slow by 8 cycles in version 0.63.
    "The Castle" (SG-1000) was affected.
  - Fixed Sega Keyboard mapping for the "Yen" key on Japanese keyboard
    (untested). Note that the mapping for certain specials keys seems not
    to be right yet using the Windows version.
  - Performed some minor calling optimizations.
  - Updated Dutch, Deutsch, Italian, Spanish and Swedish translations
    with missing messages. (Thanks to their respective mainteners!)


 MEKA 0.63                Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Implemented a cyclic color allocation algorythm, reducing palette
    changes even more in some games. Users with videocard/drivers having
    problems changing palette can expect less slowdown in Game Gear games.
  - Tested every single Master System games, and wrote a multiplayer games
    list out of them. It is included in the emulator (MULTI.TXT).
  - Added 21 missing undocumented Z80 opcodes in the ED instruction set,
    including the wonderful OUT (A), 0.
  - Fixed PSG emulation. The holding note after text boxes shows in
    "Alex Kidd in Miracle World" is no more, and noise channel writes were
    fixed (as used by CodeMasters games: Micro Machines drums now sounds
    correctly, etc...). Thanks to the great Maxim for his informations!
  - Fixed Light Phaser shooting position for when left column blanking is
    enabled (a bug leaked in since a few version).
  - Fixed 64-bytes ROM footer detection.
  - Fixed a bug affecting Hardware Reset and ROM reloading on SG-1000/SC-3000
    and Colecovision emulation. As far as I know, only "Pac-Man" (Coleco)
    was affected after an Hardware Reset, but other ROMs could as well.
    Thanks to James Carter for the bug report.
  - Fixed a two-years-old bug that may lead MEKA to crash when loading
    a savestate that was previously used under the debugger.
  - Fixed Sega Keyboard mapping for the unusual "Pi" / "Ro" key, so
    Japanese users can use it at its standard mapping location.
    Thanks to Yujiro for the bug report.
  - FPS Counter is now enabled/disabled by pressing Alt+F, instead of
    keeping F pressed.
  - [Windows] Fixed time display.
  - Updated to newer GCC version, hopefully little improving performances.
  - Added and modified entries to the checksum and compatibility lists.
    Some interesting ones I could rename after redumping:
      Alex Kidd in Miracle World [A] --> Alex Kidd in Miracle World [Export]
      Alex Kidd in Miracle World [B] --> Alex Kidd in Miracle World [USA]


 MEKA 0.62c               Emulation: 98%     Speed: 57%     Features: 80%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Various fixes.
  - Released Windows version.
  - Added "compatibility list" and "changes list" items in the help menu,
    allowing you to open them with the internal text viewer.
  - Due to improving computer speed, default blitters now all have vsync
    enabled, for smoother screen refresh. It is of course still and always
    possible to disable vsync manually (see MEKA.BLT file).

  - Sorry for the huge delay in such a minor update. I've tweaked the Z80
    core a bit again to fix a little bug that I introduced myself and which
    puzzled me for a while. I took the occasion also to upgrade to Marat's
    latest debugger (now showing inline interrupt informations).
  - Battery backed RAM is now scanned so unnecessary pages are not saved
    in the .SAV file (this was previously already done, but only inside
    of save states).
  - Added new entries to the checksum and compatibility lists.
  - Updated Spanish localisation.

 Compatibility notes:
  - Sonic Blast [GG] minor glitches on title screen in non Japanese mode
    has been confirmed to appear on a real Game Gear, so the game is now
    marked as perfectly working.
  - Thanks to the new 93c46 EEPROM emulator, Game Gear perfect compatibility
    has now increased to 98.09% (counting like FreezeSMS does, that gives us
    a whooping 150.00% :)
  - Statistics: as far as I know, out of the 7 Game Gear games marked as
    NON-WORKING, 5 games requires a simulation of LCD blurry persistance to
    show up without flickering, 1 may be severly broken (not possible to
    complete the game), and 1 is minorly broken.

 As always, please report if you find out anything you feel as not emulated
 PERFECTLY: even a single suspicious pixel, etc.. Thank you!

  - Rewrote 93c46 EEPROM emulation from stratch, it now works and saves
    data properly. This fixes the following Game Gear games:
      - Majors Pro Baseball
      - Nomo's World Series Baseball (J)
      - Pro Yakyuu GG League (J)
      - World Series Baseball [A]
      - World Series Baseball [B]
      - World Series Baseball 95
  - Emulated onboard 64 kb RAM chip of Ernie Els Golf (GG).
  - For the sake of accuracy, started to implement emulation of the four
    slighty different VDP chipsets used in Master System 1/2, Game Gear and
    Megadrive (compatibility mode). They all have subtle differences, causing
    some games not to work perfectly on all of them.
  - Fixed glitches in Ys (Japanese version), using 315-5124 VDP emulation.
  - Fixed bugs in Z80 emulation, letting the Game Over screen for Rambo III
    to appears normally - and this required many many hours of work! (thanks
    to Jonas Persson for reporting the bug). Also changed behavior of EI
    instruction, fixing Double Dragon for Game Gear (again).
  - Fixed VDP refresh disable emulation for Game Gear.
  - Fixed YM-2413 state restoring when loading a save with FM playing.
  - Now store YM-2413 state initialization in VGM files.
  - If available, store Japanese game name (in romanji form) in VGM files.
  - Fixed shifted instruction offset in debugger.
  - Updated TECH.TXT with instructions about how to build a DB-9 adapter
    to connect SMS Joypads on your PC.
  - Added full French (by Overture 1928) and Swedish (by Henrik Sankala)
    localisations. Complete Italian localisation (by Andra Ballandino).
  - Fixed minor display bug in the Inputs configuration tool.

 This version may or not have minor glitches on certain games (like, a single
 pixel or a single blinking row at the top or the bottom of the screen).
 Please report those glitches if you notice any. Thanks!

  - Moved 104 messages to MEKA.MSG, allowing for full localization of
    the menus. 99% of MEKA is now localizable. Updated the following
    languages: English, German, Redneck, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish.
  - Improved Z80 core (timing and interrupt emulation bug).
  - Fixed Rise of the Robots (GG), MEKA being the first emulator to play
    it without glitches (and even without, it sucks! :)
  - Fixed most or all (?) glitches in Formula 1 (SMS) two-players mode
    (maybe not the right way yet).
  - Fixed Double Dragon (GG) which was not working since an update of
    the Z80 core (from fMSX) several version ago.
  - Country changes now immediately takes effects (no need to reset).
  - Tweaking interrupt emulation for SG-1000/SC-3000/SF-7000 and Coleco
    Vision drivers. Those changes should not affect anything.
  - Fixed 'Parallel' video blitter, odd frames were not updated when
    using the blitter with software 3-D Glasses mode enabled.
  - Fixed crash of SF-7000 driver when loading a corrupted floppy disk.
  - Fixed YM-2413 logging in VGM files (Register & Value were reversed!)
  - Updated SDSC Header support for version 1.01 (adding Author field).
  - Added Golden Axe theme by Death Adder. (uncomment to use in GUI)
  - Updated to Allegro WIP 3.9.39 and reapplied all custom patchs.
    Changed SideWinder autodetection process a bit. Hope it works!
  - Reduced executable.

  - Improved timing in Z80 core.
  - Fixed voices that weren't ok (Alex Kidd: the Lost Stars..).
    Voices in many many games were tested, finally marked them as 'Ok' in
    the compatibility list.
  - Due to timing improvments, now Space Harrier [50 Hz version] has correct
    glitches (like on a real system) when running in NTSC mode. It is now
    configured to automatically use PAL/SECAM by default.
  - Removed the need of specific IPeriod setting for some Codemasters
    games, meaning that they will now run even if you delete MEKA.NAM.
  - Added sample accurate VGM logging, allowing to log voices. The option
    was previously grayed, it is activated now that all voices are Ok.
  - Updated to VGM version 1.01, to include original TV type information
    (NTSC or PAL/SECAM) in the file, allowing to play at a different rate.
  - Fixed minor sprite masking bug affecting scrolling games in certain
    conditions. Evander Holyfield Boxing (Game Gear) was affected.
  - Added support for Coleco Vision header/footer in order to load the
    newly released "Pac Man" and "Dig Dug" ROMs from CGE 2001.
  - Fixed a minor bug when loading an in-game savestate from the BIOS.
  - Fixed file loader sorting so that if present, ".." is always on top.
  - Added/fixed entrys to the checksum and compatibility lists.
  - Added two Sonic themes by H Hog. (uncomment to use in GUI)

  - Fixed vertical scanline counter emulation.
  - Fixed a minor hardware collision bug introduced in version 0.59.
  - Fixed usage of '%' in ROM comment field.
  - Changed message logging (with /LOG) to avoid cutting text in the file
    when it doesn't fit on the GUI message box.

  - Various changes to the sound engine:
     - Fixed PSG Periodic Noise emulation (bass in some Marble Madness tunes,
       Daffy Duck in Hollywood, and few other games). Thanks Ziria and Maxim!
     - Added PAL/SECAM machines accurate base clock for PSG wave generation
       (pitch is around 1% off from NTSC machines).
     - Added VGM logging. VGM (for Video Game Music) is a new file format
       recently developed on S8-Dev with collaboration of Dave, Maxim and
       some other people. Maxim has wrote a WinAMP plugin already.
       Check out the newly created Music Section on SMS Power at
       http://www.smspower.org/music !
     - Added PSG registers to the technical information window.
  - Fixed a very weird bug introduced in version 0.58, where a certain sprite
    configuration and positionning could screws up the whole emulator! This
    caused problems in Terminator 2: The Judgment Day and Ghouls'n Ghosts.
  - Added Korean mapper (9) emulation, as used by Dodgeball King.
  - Added Italian messages translations (by Andrea Ballandino).
  - Added German messages translations (by Tilman Hesse).
  - Fixed some Português messages.
  - Fixed/added accentued characters in some Brazilian game names.
  - Added new "Mario Must Die" theme, with a nice handdrawn picture :-)
  - Added new entrys to the checksum and compatibility lists.
  - Fixed and improved various minor things.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Fixed the missing soundcard selection menu in some cases.
  - Added printing of SDSC Header informations when found. The SDSC Header
    has been defined and created by the SMS Power developement team (based
    on Eric Quinn's idea) for homebrewn programs.
  - Drawn Latin-Extended characters (Unicode 0080-00FF) in the big font.
    Accents are now usable everywhere in MEKA. Be sure to use accents from
    the Latin-Extended table (usually used by Windows programs, not DOS ones).
  - Added Spanish messages translations (by Antonio J. Bazalo).
  - Added Português messages translations (by Rodrigo C. Rubio).
  - Added "WIP" (Work In Progress) parameter in language definition, to
    disable warnings and informations when the language is uncomplete.
  - Squashed one very minor flag bug in the browser when a ROM had an
    number after a space, at the end of its filename.

  - Fixed various minor bugs.
  - Fixed two scrolling emulation bugs in video mode 5. They did not
    affect any game, but for the sake of accuracy, better fixing them!
  - Added Dutch messages translations (by Mark van Tilburg) and Redneck
    messages translations (by Maxim, using Dialectizer). Fry mah hide!
  - Added /LOAD command line parameter, to start directly with a savestate
    loaded (so you can make yourself batchfile loading a certain state.)
  - Added several new entrys to the checksum and compatibility lists, and
    fixed some existing ones. Added an USA flag and set the flag to all
    SMS games only released in USA (Alf, King's Quest, Montezuma's Revenge).
  - Added one new happy theme from the french movie "Amélie Poulain".

 Again, please report if you notice any bug/glitche with any game, that is
 not mentionned in the compatibility list. The VDP fix applied in this
 version is also a massive compatibility test, and I would like to know
 if it has any unexpected behavior on other games. So play, play, play! :)

  - Added PSG sound logging to WAV files, accessible from the Sound menu.
  - Rewrote messaging system, added localization support.
    Moved all messages to an external file, MEKA.MSG. You can now change
    80% of the texts used in MEKA, and translate it to the language of your
    choice. I am however NOT YET sure about how accents will work, since it
    depends on the font used.
    This feature required a pass on all existing code and so took plenty
    of time to do (10+ hours), I might have screwed a few messages during
    the change, so be sure to send me an e-mail if you notice anything
    unusual.
  - Implemented a VDP quirk found in Master System 2 but not Master System 1
    or Game Gear, discovered by Charles Mac Donald (thanks Charles!). This
    one fixes Cosmic Spacehead *BUT* might screws up few other games. I did
    a bit of testing but couldn't do them all again, so please report if you
    notice anything unusual with another game.
  - Improved hardware sprite collision accuracy, fixed a bug in some
    cases where it was previously framerate dependant, and rewrote the
    whole code in assembly.
  - Changed initializations messages and some other messages.
  - Fixed an incorrect numbers of TV lines in PAL/SECAM TV emulation (due
    to a typo - thanks goes to cgfm2 for pointing me this stupid error!),
    allowing removal of a few custom MEKA.NAM parameters (Daffy Duck in
    Hollywood..).
  - Fixed the annoying bug that caused crashes on startup under DOS when
    sound was enabled.
  - Fixed a minor bug in Codemaster mapper emulation, that affected the
    checksum check of 'Drop Zone' (although the game worked).
  - Fixed crash when using a patch defined in MEKA.PAT that write outside
    of any existing data.
  - Added (very) quick and (very) dirty frame-per-frame advance by pressing
    ALT-F12. In fact, it will unpause the game then pause it back next frame.
  - Updated Colecovision compatibility list and added some product IDs,
    thanks to Tincho DJ.
    The current state with Colecovision games is: a mess :(
    Someone will lots of Colecovision knowledge would be very helpful
    to help sorting out all bad dumps, testing games and redumping others.

 Lots of fixes, for a total of twenty working hours.
 Please also note in documentation that *I HAVE MOVED HOUSE*, that is
 in case you planned to send something.

  - Various minor fixes and improvements.
  - Fixed startup delay (and sometimes crash) when autodetecting Sidewinders.
  - Fixed and improved the new dynamic palette handler, avoiding palettes
    overflow on some Game Gear games such as Sonic & Tails 2 / Triple Trouble,
    Sonic 1 or Deep Duck Trouble. The fourth level of Sonic 1 is however
    not yet perfect when both air and water are shown on screen.
    Thanks to ICEknight for pointing the bug out.
  - Made various clean and corrections to the main sound engine structure.
    It should not have broken anything, but please report if you notice
    something unusual. Noticable changes are that:
     - MEKA refuse to start if sound initialization has failed.
     - Sound is now muted while certain long operations are being processed.
     - Sound card type is not lost if you only disable sound.
     - An incorrect BLASTER environnement variable is now reported.
  - Added an algorithm to automatically detect certain mappers and select
    them when the ROM is unknown.
  - Fixed vertical scrolling emulation in certain special cases.
  - Fixed zoomed sprites in SMS/GG video mode. They were accidentally
    screwed up by a typo (!) in previous version, and affected Virtua
    Fighter Mini.
  - Fixed a bug with checksum handling. In some cases, ROMs with only a
    few different bytes were previously not recognized as different.
  - Fixed usage of the ';' key in the input system (now usable), previously
    the character was considered as beginning a comment in MEKA.INP.
  - Fullscreen messages are now correctly displayed when the current emulated
    system uses a resolution higher than your fullscreen resolution.
  - Fixed debugger breakpoint when loading a save state.
  - Added some new entrys to the checksum and compatibility lists,
    and fixed few existing ones. Added a french flag, currently used
    for games translated in french.


 MEKA 0.57                 Emulation: 97%     Speed: 57%     Features: 79%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
 Note: I made lots of little sources changes in this version. Things have
 been tested, but in case you notice anything unusual, please contact me.

  - Rewrote dynamic palette handler, minimizing actual hardware palette
    changes, reducing snow and generally reducing flickering when games
    were abusing of palette changes (like the "Happy Birthday" demo, or
    some Game Gear games). Due to that change, Palette and Tile viewers
    are now slighty slower than before, but since they are not used for
    playing, it is fine.
  - Rewrote hardware sprites collision emulation a more accurate way,
    fixing Cheese Catastrophe (SMS) bonus catching. There was an easy
    way to get it to work, but technically speaking, it was not the
    right one. Instead I emulated the feature a better way so that
    theorically, any tricky uses of it should be working. Speed might
    have dropped of about 1 FPS on slow computers.
    (Thanks to nop.nop for the bug report.)
  - Added data dumping facilities for developers and hackers.
    You can now dump the following to a file:
      - RAM (raw or text hex/ascii)
      - VRAM (raw or text hex/ascii)
      - Palette (raw or text colors definitions)
      - Sprites (raw or text sprites definition)
      - VDP Regs (raw or text binary/hex)
      - OnBoard Memory (raw or text hew/ascii)
    Those functionnalities are available by starting MEKA with /DEBUG.
  - Added Sega Keyboard (SK-1100) hardware detection emulation. You can
    know use the emulated keyboard to play SG-1000 (and early SMS) games
    supporting it.
  - Added a 'none' value for joypad driver, to disable any kind of
    detection (as it may be slow on some computers). See MEKA.INP.
  - Battery backed RAM optional pages are now not saved when their
    content is null.
  - Optimized the technical information viewer that was previously
    too slow. Also made cosmetic changes to the informations shown.
  - Fixed error message that said MEKA was unable to write SaveRAM
    to write, while it did correctly.
  - Fixed savestate loading bug in some very specific cases when using
    a custom mapper.
  - Fixed sprite drawing in overscan video mode.
  - The selected tile in the tile viewer is now refreshed if modified.
  - Fixed PSG volume bug, where volumes 14 and 15 were actually the same.
    (thanks to Martin Konrad for noticing it)
  - Changed the 'palette_bright' option to a 'palette' option that can
    be either 'muted' or 'bright', the later being now the default, since
    many people suggested that it was better than the old default one.
    Also added a switch in the GUI options box to change it dynamically.
  - VSync is now automatically avoided if a speed faster than 70 hz is
    being used. So you can use a blitter with VSync enabled and still
    profit of accelerations if you want them sometimes (skip intros, etc..).
  - Partially rewrote popup menu code. Also hacked a bit to fixed the bug
    when more than 32 themes were enabled on the same time.
  - Added the usual amount of new themes and new database entries.
  - Added some new comments to the configuration file.
  - Converted all ASM code to NASM format, for better portability.
  - Ported MEKA to Windows. Cool.
//  - Added NES emulation:
//    - Scanline based PPU emulation, H/V Mirroring, Sprites.
//    - Mappers 0, 1, 2, 3 emulation. Enough to play the classics.
//    - Basic input emulation.
//    - SaveRAM emulation.
//    - Savestates are supported as well, with mappers dependent
//      informations being saved.


 MEKA 0.56                 Emulation: 97%     Speed: 57%     Features: 79%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Added Sega Super Control Station emulation, codename SF-7000.
    The SF-7000 is a rare addon for the Sega Computer 3000, providing it
    with a 3" Floppy Disk Drive, 64 kbytes of RAM, a parallel printer port
    and a RS-232C port. The later two are only partially emulated as anyway
    there is no way to use the emulated connection (ex: for printing) yet.
    Many thanks goes to Marc Le Douarain for his help and dumps of his old
    disks, and Ulrich Cordes for the FDC-765 emulation (see documentation).

    I added in the documentation a paragraph about how to use SC-3000 and
    SF-7000 Basic software, as it is needed to load programs for the later.
    Also, I am still looking for a real SF-7000 and any softwares!

  - Added sprite flickering emulation in video mode 5 (SMS/GG), and
    interfaced so you can now enable it if you feel like playing shooters
    with invisible bullets. It is available in the VIDEO->FLICKERING menu.
  - MEKA is now ignoring those rarely present 64 bytes footers.
  - Fixed Ninja Gaiden (GG version) hand on intermission animation.
  - Fixed PAUSE button which was broken in version 0.55b.
  - Fixed blinking sides when a program was using text mode (Sega Basic, ..)
    with a border color different than black.
  - Fixed Sega Keyboard letters color.
  - Fixed /LOG command line option which was ignoring the given filename.
  - Added and fixed entrys in the compatibility and checksum lists.
  - Various minor changes - changed messages, fixed typos..


 MEKA 0.55b                Emulation: 97%     Speed: 57%     Features: 79%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Added configurable mouse speed values in the MEKA.INP file.
  - Fixed mouse under Windows NT / Windows 2000.


 MEKA 0.55                 Emulation: 97%     Speed: 57%     Features: 79%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Added builtin documentation, accessible from the "HELP" menu.
  - Entirely revamped the input system. I originally fixed Paddle Control
    emulation then noticed the problem I was having with Super Racing was
    due to a bug in the original game. I did not feel like adding a cheap
    hack and beside it was time to clean it up, I just needed a reason :)
    Inputs related changes you will notice are:

      - Added configuration tool, showing small pictures of peripherals
        being used (hope you like the pictures, as I spent a long time
        drawing them). This tool allows you to see currently available inputs
        sources, enable/disable them, and change their key/buttons mapping.
        No more dealing with obscure scancodes numbers (finally).
        To keep going with the MEKA tradition, every configuration bit is
        stored in a human-readable and manually editable file: MEKA.INP.
        You can access most of the functionnalities from under the interface
        but experienced users might want to check this file out. The new
        input system is high-level oriented and allows you to do many nice
        things like playing with two pads on the same time or mapping pause
        to a mouse button. Whatever you feel.
      - Any joypad/joystick corresponding to the driver selected in MEKA.INP
        should be automatically enabled on starting, and available for use.
      - Renamed left occurences of peripherals that were incorrectly named
        (Paddle Controller -> Paddle Control, Light Gun -> Light Phaser)
      - Improved Paddle Control emulation so that they will work in Japanese
        mode, and allowing Super Racing to detect a paddle when plugged on,
        instead of the regular joypad.
      - Fixed a precision bug in Paddle Control 2 emulation.
      - Added support for a second Sport Pad / Trackball.
      - Added digital input source emulation with the mouse, so basically
        you can play any joypad game with a mouse now. Expect being really
        frustrated with most games, but it is actually very cool for shooters
        and games where you do not have to do 'long' movements. Try R-Type.

  - Added 3-D Glasses emulation, with both software and hardware modes:
      - Software mode let you play 3-D games by showing only
        images of a choosen side (left or right).
      - Hardware mode supports REAL Sega 3-D Glasses connected on
        your PC through the communication port! See TECH.TXT for more
        informations about how to build a Sega 3-D Glasses adapter
        and enjoy a new dimension of videogaming :-)
        Warning: 3-D Glasses support through the COM port is still not
        in perfect stage, meaning that you may experience flickering.
        A blitter with VSync enabled is *strongly* recommended.
        Also stop playing every 30 minutes eyes you'll become blind :)

//  - Added CodeMasters cartridge mapper emulation (for both Master System
//    and Game Gear modes).
//  - Added emulation for overscan video mode, and dynamic screen resizing
//    while the game is running.
  - Tweaked VDP code for potentially more accurate side effect emulation.
  - Fixed sprite collisions in certain cases. The following Colecovision
    games are now perfectly playable:
      - Carnival (Bonus Level is ok)
      - Jumpman Junior (Ladders on level 3 are ok).
      - Pitfall 2 (No false hit on the third screen).
      - Venture.
    Thanks goes to the one who sent me a long e-mail about collision
    detection some months ago, but which I unfortunately lost and was
    then unable to answer. E-mail me if you are still around :)
  - Fixed hard pausing. You can now safely take screenshots after pausing
    with a message shown on the screen, as it will not be shown in the shot.
  - Fixed loading of very small ROMs, which affected Tic Tac Toe on
    Colecovision, and maybe your very own demos programs.
  - Implemented Antiriad's hack to Allegro - used in Raine - to permit
    usage of Sidewinders while their driver is loaded (not tested). Thanks!
  - Fixed the Eagle blitter which was not centered and showed garbage
    in some machines. Also fixed the default Eagle blitter configuration
    which limited speed to 30 FPS even on a very fast system. What a loss!
    By the way, Eagle does in fact looks nice with a few games. Try R-Type.
  - Slighty optimized memory accesses and tile refresh.
  - Changed the key to save screenshots from F12 to PrintScreen. If you
    are using Windows, be sure to configure the properties of your DOS box
    to enable the use of the PrintScreen key if you want to make screenshots.
  - Added F12 shortcut to hard pause emulation.
  - Added access to enabling/disable GUI Vertical Sync in the options box.
  - Fixed a bug that prevented Battery Backed RAM or EEPROM to be saved when
    freeing ROM.
  - Added a technical document (TECH.TXT) with basis informations about
    the systems, as well as the schematic for the 3-D Glasses adapter.
  - Reduced default FM writing delay, that should speed up the two games
    over-abusing of FM writes. Try R-Type title screen.
  - Added various name and checksum entrys, and corrected many existing ones.
    Should have noted out all Game Gear games running in Master System mode,
    fixed some Colecovision names and date, and generally improved accuracy.
    Thanks goes to Maxim and Luke2 for their precious help! :)
  - Added Korean flag in the file loader and associated Super Tetris with it.
    There are still several Korean games to dump, however.
  - Fixed leap year calculation (for display of dates).
  - Fixed a crashing bug when passing too many parameters on command line.
  - Added the usual bunch of new GUI themes, and more pictures are available
    from the homepage.
  - Plenty of minor fixes here and here.


 MEKA 0.54b                Emulation: 97%     Speed: 56%     Features: 79%

  - Made some very minor fixes.
  - Added two new themes (Deep Purple and Deep Brown).


 MEKA 0.54                 Emulation: 97%     Speed: 56%     Features: 79%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Updated to the documentation, improved many parts and added new things.
    Please read it!
  - Fixed invalid vertical sprite wrapping in video mode 2 (bug introduced
    in version 0.51, slighty affecting The Castle and maybe other games).
  - Added PSG wave synthesis sound rate setting in the configuration file.
    Rate is no more fixed to a weird value like in all previous versions,
    avoiding the clicks and noise with certains soundcards. You can also
    change the rate to the default values of 11025, 22050 and 44100 Hz from
    the GUI pop-up menus.
  - Added separate PSG channel enabling/disabling. Mainly useful for
    musicians who want to listen to different channels separately, but
    it is also very fun to disable some channels and play games with
    somewhat new musics :)
  - Fixed FM bug when hard pausing and unpausing in some games.
  - Addams Family, Operation Wolf and Sonic Blast now automatically run in
    PAL/Secam mode when NTSC is selected, due to the games having bugs in
    NTSC mode.
  - Fixed the badly positionned line of Hang On in Hang On / Safari Hunt.
  - If brutally forced to close (like when switching to a blitter using an
    invalid resolution), MEKA now switch back to its starting directory.
  - Added screenshot filename template to the configuration file. You can
    now configure weither you want padding, short or long filenames, etc..
    Also changed screenshot numbering starting value from 0 to 1.
  - Added "integer stretched" display of the themes background pictures
    (see MEKA.THM).
  - Added new themes, some of them using nice background pictures you are
    invited to download at http://www.smspower.org/meka/themes.


 MEKA 0.53c                Emulation: 97%     Speed: 56%     Features: 79%

 Game Gear compatibility rate is now of 95.80%. It is the only unperfect
 system and that's mainly due to the lack of LCD screen persistence of
 vision emulation.

  - Kishin Douji Zenki very minor graphic bug was a bug in the game itself,
    not in MEKA. Thanks goes to Adol brothers for their help on this one.
  - Added a patch to fix a bug in Walter Payton Football (in the game itself)
    preventing it to works on machines with a FM Chipset.
  - Fixed Wanted patch, I had accidentally commented a line out.
  - Fixed California Games 2 minor graphic bug when selecting the top left
    entry of the menu (screwed in version 0.52). Thanks Pieter!
  - Added new entrys to checksum and compatibility list.


 MEKA 0.53b                Emulation: 96%     Speed: 56%     Features: 79%

 I finally figured out what was the problem of the major slow down in
 some video modes when page flipping was enabled. Actually using page
 flipping need to force vertical synchronisation in most video modes, so
 enabling them both will make the program synchronise twice per frame to
 the vertical refresh, causing speed to be limited to about 30/35 FPS.
 The default blitter definition files now have Page Flipping modes enabled
 by mode, replacing the obsolote VSync modes.

  - Fixed a bug preventing files to appear in the file browser under DOS.
  - Added all known Colecovision dumps to the checksum/names list.
    Names are based on Cowering's GoodColeco utility.
  - Game name is now dynamically updated under the GUI is a country change
    affect the current name.
  - Fixed "Rise of the Robots" by forcing NTSC mode when it is not enabled.
  - Added a patch to fix a bug in Wanted (in the game itself) preventing it
    to works on machines with a FM Chipset.
  - Fixed a bug sometimes happening where disabling background layer
    display wouldn't work.
  - Added 5 new themes (commented by default).


 MEKA 0.53                 Emulation: 96%     Speed: 56%     Features: 79%

 Master System compatibility rate has now reached the perfect 100.00%
 assuming out of the 373 tested ROMs none was broken in a recent version.
 Something major have changed in this version and which might screw just
 about any game. So if you find anything unusual that might be a bug,
 please report it to me. As soon as possible I'll spend a week trying
 all games again.

 Enabling page flipping is known to cut down the speed by a factor of two.
 This is obviously a bug as page flipping should not affect performances
 so at the moment I suggest avoiding it and enabling VSync instead.

 As a side news, I have ported MEKA to FreeBSD/NetBSD. It probably compiles
 under Linux also, and whenever I can get my hands on a computer running
 Windows applications at a correct speed, a Windows port will be worked on.

 [RC3]
  - Fixed temporary sound bug when loading savestates in certains cases.
  - Added border surrounding selected tile in tile viewer.

 [RC2]
  - Added TV Type switch to change between NTSC and PAL/SECAM.
  - Improved tile viewer so that a click on a tile shows its number and
    the tile itself. Might be useful for developers and ROM hackers.
  - Improved file browser: added a "Reload Directory" button and a
    "Load Names" button to load full game names for all files.
  - Fixed GP Rider (GG) road corruption.
  - Fixed NBA Action (GG) abnormal flickering.
  - Fixed NBA Jam TE (GG, previously unknown bug) and Surfs Ninja (GG).
  - Fixed reset key in Sega Keyboard emulation.
  - Fixed Gear Game communication port emulation somewhat broken in
    previous version and which affected Pac Attack.
  - Fixed secret games left side of the screen bug in fullscreen mode.

 [RC1]
  - Fixed Y's (Japanese).
  - Improved auto frame skipper synchronization to the choosen speed.
  - Added full TV Oekaki Graphic Board and Pen emulation, using mouse.
    Button 1 simulate a pen press and button 2 simulates the pen being away
    of the graphic board - when it is away you can use standard inputs. Now
    you will be able to draw with the emulator ^_^
    Thanks to Toshi for sending out the Graphic Board.
  - Compiled with the newest patched Seal Audio Library, improving overall
    sound quality (16-bit mode was somewhat useless in previous versions),
    and ALLOWING SOUND TO WORK ON SOUND BLASTER 128 SOUND CARDS, finally.
    A big thanks goes to whoever patched Seal for that.
    (I guess it is someone to the MAME team, but I am not sure.)
  - File browser now go in the root of drive if current directory is invalid.
  - Removed a broken line in the MEKA.NAM file causing Back to the Future 3
    to show a black screen.
  - Added even more new entrys in the compatibility and checksum lists.

  [Sources Changes]
  - Command line handling now ignore case (for Unix version).
  - Moved all sources for Marat Z80 Core to Z80MARAT/ directory.
  - Fixed a lot of minor things for Unix/Windows portability.
  - Revamped Eagle handling in makefile/#define. Now MEKA compiles
    correctly without Eagle enabled.
  - Rewrote UPDBUILD tool in C. No more Pascal needed to recompile.
  - Added CONFIG_J.C/.H and CONFIG_V.C/.H with big drivers tables.
  - Rewrote directory reading for file browser.
  - Improved Makefile on various points.


 MEKA 0.52                 Emulation: 96%     Speed: 56%     Features: 79%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
 Compatibility rates as of version 0.52:

  Master System: 99.72%
    (not perfect because of the Japanese version of Ys).
  Sega Game 1000: 100.00%
  Sega Computer 3000: 100.00%
    (excluding emulation of optional peripherals such as the Sega Printer)
  Game Gear: 95.03%
    (excluding gear-to-gear emulation used by certains two players games)

  - Fixed the minor glitches in:
   - Back to the Future 2
     (black section flickering between the road and status bar)
   - Gangster Town
     (little line of skyblue pixels on the top of the car in the first scene)
   - Operation Wolf
     (minor graphic glitches on the top of the bottom bar when shooting)

 Tested Wonderboy in Monsterworld on a real system and confirmed the minor
 glitch when the menu is vertically scrolling is a bug in the game itself.

 Did some research about Ys (J/FM), with help from Toshi.
 It is not considered anymore as a bad dump. The bug happening in MEKA also
 happens when using a real Game Gear or a Megadrive with an adapter.
 However the game show a perfect status bar on a Japanese Master System,
 so the bad behavior is considered as a bug of MEKA, even if in the first
 place it is due to a bug in the game code taking advantage of an odd
 behavior of the Japanese Master System.

 Also:
  - Improved run-time TMS9918 video mode detection.
  - Fixed Hyper Pro Yakyuu 92 (GG).
  - Reduced flickers in NBA Action (GG).
  - Fixed freezing until a key is pressed when loading the Japanese BIOS.
  - Fixed yet another silly bug introduced in previous version and screwing
    some SC-3000 software such as the Sega Basic.
  - Added new entrys to compatibility and checksum lists. Also redone
    SC-3000 list with names corrections for Japanese educational softwares.
  - Fixed potential VDP bug - wasn't affecting any games, but could have.
  - Implemented MAME Z80 CPU Core but did not enabled it in the public
    version as it doesnt bring anything better than Marat's core: they
    are on par, but MAME license is quite limiting.
  - Improved documentation inside of the MEKA.BLT file.
  - Fixed a bunch of minor bugs. Fixed handing of ROM smaller than eight
    kilobytes. Fixed empty entry creation in the VFN database. Fixed a bug
    in windows repositionning when changing resolution.
  - Reduced executable size.
  - Added preliminary Action Replay emulation (private).

 And also:
  - Added background picture caching for a faster switch to the GUI when
    a big image is used on background.
  - Added a bunch of new themes into the distribution package.
    Background pictures for some of the themes are available on a new
    site at http://www.emucamp.com/meka/themes
  - As of now the PICS/ directory should be considered as the one everyone
    have to use to share themes easily. You can still have your own themes
    pictures stored anyway, anyway.


 MEKA 0.51 OC Edition      Emulation: 96%     Speed: 56%     Features: 79%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
 SG-1000 perfect compatibility rate is now of 100%

  - Added the possibility of adding a custom background picture in themes.
    Keyword to be used in MEKA.THM is "background_pic". Pictures need to
    be in PCX format and a maximum of 128 colors will be used. You can
    zoom, tile or center the picture using the appropriate keywords.
  - Added desktop saving. Active windows and their position are now saved
    and restored back when loading MEKA.
  - Rewrote sprite engine for video modes 1/2/3, fixing the minor bug in
    Pitfall 2 (SG-1000) and Rockn'Bolt (SG-1000). Probably also fixed some
    Colecovision games. Added optional flickering emulation.


 MEKA 0.50                 Emulation: 96%     Speed: 56%     Features: 78%

 Master System perfect compatibility rate is now of 98.90%
 Games still causing problems are:
   Back to the Future 2
     (black section flickering between the road and status bar)
   Gangster Town
     (little line of skyblue pixels on the top of the car in the first scene)
   Operation Wolf
     (minor graphic glitches on the top of the bottom bar when shooting)
   Wonderboy in Monsterworld
     (minor glitche on the menu vertical scrolling line when pressing pause)
 Found out that the bug in Aerial Assault was happening on a real system.
 So it's not considered as a bug anymore.

 Next step will be to improve Game Gear perfect compatibility rate (94% now).

 [RC5]
  - Added icons package from various contributors (see ICONS.ZIP).
  - Fixed SG-1000/SC-3000 border color emulation, screwed in RC4.
  - Added Massage savegame converter. Rename a .MSD file in the MEKA
    naming convention and it will be automatically converted when loading.
    You might in some cases experience sound or various other problems
    with certain games. The usual solution is to pause and unpause the
    game, else try to change screen/level.
  - Fixed potential palette problems with some video card/mode couples.
  - Slighty improved voice emulation.
  - Compiled with latest Allegro library, adding support for the following
    joysticks/pads drivers:
      - DB9 pads through parallel ports (allow to plug real SMS pads!)
      - PC Engine pads through parallel ports
      - Saturn pads with IF-SEGA interface cards for PC.

 [RC4]
  - Fixed Colecovision emulation, screwed in RC2/RC3.
  - Fixed 32k RAM mapper (The Castle, Othello..) screwed in RC2/RC3.
    (The cause of all these bugs is the rewrite of the drivers system).
  - Revamped palette update handling.
  - Made some structural optimisations, increasing speed of a few percents.
    Now Phantasy Star runs at 49 frame per seconds on my computer !
  - Fixed palette applet size when first loading a SG-1000/SC-3000/Coleco
    game from the commandline.
  - Fixed bug virtual longfile name self created list saving.
  - Added new games and product numbers to compatibility and checksum lists.
  - Rewrote palette handling, reducing snow and slighty increasing speed.
  - Blitter improvments:
      - Added page flipping.
      - Added Double TV Mode blitter.
      - Added "Perfect" blitter definition with all best features enabled

 MEKA 0.0.40 [private]       Emulation: 92%     Speed: 51%     Features: 53%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
 In this version, I have changed a lot of "vital" things in emulation
 (VDP accesses, IPeriod and line interrupts).
 Be sure to tell me if you notice *any* broken game !

  - Implemented Hiro-shi improved FM emulation code !
    Please note that FM hardware emulation is a very CPU intensive process,
    and therefore you should disable it if you doesn't have a fast computer,
    or the games that use it will become very slow ;)
    Also, there are still bugs in some games (Wonderboy 3, for exemple).
  - Now compiled with SEAL 1.0.6. Should fixes bugs with newer soundcards.
  - The defaults VDP registers values are now the same as set by the BIOS.
  - Fixed lightgun position limits in fullscreen mode.
  - Fixed a VDP bug introduced in 0.0.39.5 (Wonderboy 3..).
  - Started working on virtual machine. This required a MAJOR code overhaul,
    which means lot of work. It was also one of the last things required to
    be able to implement the "Load ROM" option, so stop requesting it :-)
  - Fixed patching system (no more crashes).
  - Fixed a graphic bug in "F16 Fighters" and "F16 Fighting Falcon".
  - Finally managed to find the "magic" IPeriod value (200) and added an
    option to choose a different value when it is stored in the rom database.
    This change also improve speed ! The following games are fixed:
      - Altered Beast (SMS)
      - Barcelona '92 (SMS) - still has bug (bad dump?)
      - Monaco Grand Prix (SMS)
      - NBA Action (GG)
      - Shadow of the Beast (SMS)
      - WWF Steel Cage Challenge (SMS)
  - Fixed Mortal Kombat 2 (GG).
  - Changed a few things in the Game Gear interrupt system.
  - Various code changes, related to Jason Nelson's Windows port.
  - Fixed a bug so that "gui_access_mode = flipped" should not crashes
    anyway (but there is still a lot of flickers, and it is slower than
    the "direct" mode - although faster than "buffered").
  - Master System games marked with "Ok, No Voices" are not counted anymore
    as non-working. And hopefully Hiro-shi will get voices to work soon :)
  - Added support for pending interrupts, although I didn't noticed any
    changes in any games.
  - Various GUI code improvments.
  - Various optimizations.
  - Improved theme system, added a new color, improved existing themes.
    Added a new "Emucamp" theme (by Puyolin) and removed the "Peach" theme,
    as it really really sucked (and I doubt anyone was using it).
  - Added a VSync option in the configuration file (for fast PC).
  - Fixed screenshot size when Eagle is enabled.
  - Improved TV effect.


 MEKA 0.0.39 [private]       Emulation: 87%     Speed: 50%     Features: 51%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Various bugs fixed, mainly related to the new sound engine.
  - Wrote documentation, and moved the history section to a separate file.
  - Improved error handling.
  - Added support for video mode 0 used in Sega Basic and Music Editor.
  - Added support for additionnal RAM used in Sega Basic and Music Editor.
  - Fixed savegames, as there was a paging problem with some games (such as
    Gunstar Heroes or Alex Kidd BMX Trial).
  - Added a very cool ROM patching system. Check the file MEKA.PAT.
  - Added dynamic CPU handlers changes, so I can assign a different (faster)
    memory handler in SC-3000 mode, for exemple.
  - Started interfacing for the Master System BIOS. Check machine->power->on.
  - Various GUI fixes and improvments:
     - Fixed some menus names.
     - Improved the theme system, improved existing themes and added a new
       one by Puyolin : Ocean.
     - Optimized pop-up menus refresh and rounded corners.
     - Reduced flicker a bit in the direct GUI access mode (see MEKA.CFG).
  - Fixed and completed keyboard mapping. Key are mapped *at the same place*
    as the SC3000 keyboard, so you can simply look at the provied picture to
    find which key to press. For exemple:
      * Eng Dier's = Left Alt
      * Home/Clear = Right Alt
      * Control    = Caps Lock
      * Graph      = Left Control
    The only exception is the "üE key, which is mapped on the tilde, as there
    is not enough room on the PC keyboard to put it at the left.
    Ins/Del is mapped to Right Control, but also to Backspace as this key is
    unused and is the more regular way to delete characters ;-)
  - Improved configuration files parsing.
  - Rewrote the function to blit the image in fullscreen mode. As a result:
      - Scanlines are now working. Press ALT-S to enable/disable them.
      - The crap 3-D parallel view can be combined with scanlines (ALT-3).
      - The eagle graphics filter now work in fullscreen mode, and can
        be enabled/disabled while running the emulator (with ALT-E).
      - Removed all effects (Eagle, 3-D, Scanlines) under the interface. It
        caused too much trouble. Maybe I will put them back later.
  - Added a better messaging / error handling system (based on Raine code).
  - Added more Master System games to the compatibility and checksum lists.
  - Fixed screenshot size and now the filename is based on the rom name.
  - Some minor optimizations.


 MEKA 0.0.38 [private]       Emulation: 87%     Speed: 49%     Features: 50%
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Hiromitsu Shioya has joigned the team and contributed with a very good
    sound engine, featuring *FM emulation* ! MEKA doesn't use Adlib / OPL
    anymore as the waves are generated, and it sounds much better. Please
    note that as of version 0.0.38, the sound engine is still in development
    and FM emulation has some bugs and missing features. It will be improved
    and should be perfect in the next version.
  - Added preliminary Gear-to-Gear communication port emulation. Just enough
    to allow "Star Gate" to run.
  - Fixed and improved keyboard emulation. Also added a shortcut (ALT-F9).
  - Added a buggy scanline option, until I found a better way to do it.
  - Various GUI fixes and improvments, included but not limited to:
     - Major pop-up menus re-organization.
     - Now pop-up menus uses gradients.
     - Added a nice background - to be used in the future.
     - Support for windows title wrapping (when the text doesn't fit).
     - Fixed a bug with the tile viewer, and slighty optimized it.
  - Fixed a major graphic bug introduced in previous version (Gauntlet, Great
    Basketball, Solomon Key and a few other games).
  - Changed default IPeriod (again!) to 226, to fix Shadow of the Beast.
  - Finally succeeded in implementing Marcel De Kogel Z80 Core. The problem
    is that Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 hang with it, so it is not yet included.
  - Fixed sprites clipping bug in SG1000 mode (Congo Bongo..).
  - Improved checksum file structure, allowing for custom fields.
    Started completing the "ID" field with all ID values. Please help !
  - Added a bunch of new Master System games to the compatibility list, with
    their checksum, and some new Game Gear games.
  - Fixed MSM recording.
  - Improved documentation.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Fixed graphics bugs in the following games:
     - Rainbow Island (no more black screen)
     - Gangster Town (minor interrupt bug)
     - Sonic Drift 2 (it is playable, but there is still some glitchs)
  - Fixed sprites priorities. The bug was introduced in version 0.0.28, but
    I didn't bothered fixing it until now :)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -

 * Perfect compatibility rate in Game Gear mode is now of 85% !
   (not counting voice emulation, used by many games)

  - Slighty optimized emulation.
  - Implemented SC3000 keyboard emulation (used in Tanoshii Sansuu and Uranai
    Angel). It tooks me more time to draw the keyboard than to emulate it :)
    Use popup menus to enable it. A keyboard will appears on the background.
    To use it, you'll have to press the corresponding keys directly on your
    keyboard. You cannot click on the keys with the mouse yet. Also, you MUST
    change the value for the "key_pause" in the configuration file to zero or
    something else to be able to use the enter key. To be fixed.
  - Reformated the compatibility list, and Mxs started adding GG titles.
  - Fixed a bug in various Game Gear games (GP Rider, Joe Montana, Lemmings).
  - Fixed a major interrupt bug in betas between 35 and 36.
  - Fixed a SG1000 graphic bug in betas between 35 and 36 (James Bond 007..).
  - Fixed a memory paging bug in Columns (Game Gear).
  - Fixed a crashing bug with the tile viewer bug SG1000/SC3000 mode when the
    game used the end of the VRAM as the tile area.
  - Now default IPeriod is now set to 227. Be sure to delete your old config
    file or update it manually if you want to use the new value.
  - Fixed a dynamic palette bug. Unfortunaly the fix slow down emulation, but
    I must keep it until I found a better way.
  - FM chipset can now be enabled and autodetected. It is disabled by default
    because nothing is emulated yet. Check the configuration file.
  - Border color is now always black (finally).
  - Added a command line help and improved parsing.
  - Memory is now properly released at the end of the program.
  - Fixed a crashing bug introduced in previous version when loading very
    large roms (such as Street Fighter 2').
  - Separated even more object files, for a faster compilation.

    the code was entirely rewritten, to allow widget integration and a more
    flexible interface. The mouse code was also rewritten.
  - Added the first widgets:
     - Little stars at the top-right of boxes, used to close them.
     - An invisible one to change the palette used in the tile viewer when
       pressing the second mouse button on it.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ───- ──- ─- -
  - Various non-emulation bugs fixed.
  - Renamed emulator to MEKA and started writing the documentation.

    slow and buggy, but I cannot believe it myself - Linux rocks :)
    Hopefully it will be as good as the DOS version soon.
  - Rewrote memory accesses. Emulation is now slighty faster and I finally
    fixed SaveRAM emulation ! The following games do not have graphics
    problems anymore: Flash, Phantasy Star (the three versions) and Y's.
    Shining Force 2 and 3 (Game Gear).
  - Fixed a bug to make Street Fighter 2' working.

  - Various non-emulation bugs fixed.
  - Fixed a palette problem that was introduced in previous version, and
    affected a few games (Gauntlet, Klax, Indiana Jones..).

    or in Power Strike 2 / Aleste 2.
  - In SG1000/SC3000 mode:
     - VDP Register 7 is now used to replace background color 0 when needed.
       It fixes the color bugs in many games (eg: Champion Soccer, Dragon
       Wang, Flicky, Pacar, Sega Flipper, Yamato..).
     - Fixed a bug in sprite engine (top of the screen in Champion Boxing,
       Girl's Garden, Orguss, Pitfall 2 and Wonderboy).
     - Fixed general bugs in VDP (sprites in Exerion, background in Yamato).

    It was not much tested, so feedback is highly needed. Be sure to tell
    me if it's working for you.
  - Added non working GUI page flipping access mode.
    Set "gui_access_mode" to "flipped" in the configuration file to see your
    machine crashing :)
  - Started interfacing for Marcel de Kogel's CPU core.
  - More cleans in the source code. Graphic hardware emulation part is now
    separated from the main object file, for a faster compilation.

  - Various non-emulation bugs fixed.
  - Cleaned source code, renamed tons of variables.
  - Added support for dynamic palette effects in Master System and Game Gear
    mode (the one in Massage sucks in Game Gear mode :)
    It fixes the color blink bug in the following Master System games:
      - California Games (various events)
      - Championship Hockey (configuration screen)
      - Gangsters Town (road scene) (still problems)
      - Golden Axe Warrior (title screen)
      - Poseidon Wars 3D (title screen)
      - Space Harrier (game)
      - Space Harrier 3D (game)

      - Gunstar Heroes (level 1)
      - Space Harrier (game) (still problems)
      - Power Strike 2 (title screen) (still problems)
      - probably a few others. I'm not testing much Game Gear games..
    Please note that it's not perfect at all, and you will still notice bugs
    in these games. But *PLEASE* contact me if you notice color related bugs
    in others games (all the one which do not use color effects), because I
    did rewrote the whole palette code and it may contains some bugs.
  - In Game Gear mode:
      - Fixed game window size.
      - Reset key is now mapped to hard reset (because no soft reset).
      - Eagle is now separately activated for each systems, so you can
        enable it only for Game Gear mode (which is a good idea).
  - More accurate manual and automatic frame skipping.
  - Rewrote the checksum code and updated the database. Sapo Xule is not
    recognized anymore as Psycho Fox. Same thing with Phantasy Star US/Port.
  - IPeriod can now be changed from the configuration file.

  - Fixed various video bugs in SG1000 emulation, the following games
    are now working: C!So, Champion Billiard, F16 Fighters and Rockn'Bolt.
  - Implemented a non-buffered GUI mode. It's much faster (+15/20 FPS on
    my machine), but expect tons of flickering and flashs when using it.
    Set "gui_buffered" to 0 in the configuration file to use this mode.
  - Now FPS counter work when auto frame skipping was disabled.
    Also added a key (F) to show current FPS in fullscreen mode.
  - Optimized tile viewer, and fixed it in SG1000/SC3000 mode.

  - Optimized new graphic engine - it's now faster than the old one.
  - Fixed horizontal tile clipping bug in new graphic engine.
  - SG1000 emulation is back, and was slighty optimized.
  - Implemented a MSM recording feature. MSM, for "Master System Music", is
    a text based format, so you can easily rip part of the music, or even
    create your own using the Master System sound hardware (which rocks :)
    The text based replayer (MSMP.EXE) is available on request.
  - Finally fixed the f*cking color bug which affected snapshots and fades.
    It looks like an Allegro's bug. Thanks to R. Mitton for finding it.
  - Fixed bugs in Battle Out Run, Sagaia, and Impossible Mission.

  - ZSMS now features a real line-per-line engine !

    Pros:
     -> Coolspot, Global Gladiator, Speedball 2 and Xenon 2 now shows all
        the sprites. You'll notice flickering sometimes, but I cannot do much
        since there is the same problem even on the real machine..
     -> Outrun and Fantasy Zone 2 do not have priority bugs anymore
     -> You can see sprites in Bart versus Space Mutants
     -> Y's is now almost perfect
     -> Psycho Fox now has the black line effect when pausing and un-pausing
     -> The same kind of effect is noticeable in Quartet title screen

    Cons:
     -> It's 18% slower. But I'll optimize it later.
     -> There are bugs on screen borders when scrolling. To be fixed.
     -> It crashes sometimes. To be fixed.
     -> SG1000 games are using an old engine, and the screen tries to
         redraw itself 11000 times per second.. so it's a bit slow :)

    The old engine was now dropped, and now I'll work on improving the new
    one to make it faster and faster (I didn't really tried to optimize the
    old one because I knew that I needed to switch to a new engine first).

  - Cleaned the source code and renamed tons of variables.
  - Various GUI improvements and fixes to make Nirv even more happy :)
  - Fixed a few things with the savegame format (still not the final one).
  - Replaced tiles decoding by a slighty faster code, provided by D.Michel.
